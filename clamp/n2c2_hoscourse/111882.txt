35yF with multiple medical problems (including SLE, restrictive
lung disease, global cardiomyopathy with severely depressed
systolic function, nephrotic syndrome), with recent admission
[**Date range (1) 68983**] for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, admitted with
shortness of breath, tachycardia, and persistent nausea.
.
#) Cardiomyopathy: Pt was initially admitted to the hospitalist
service but transferred for cath and endocardial biopsy in the
setting of worsening EF.  Her cardiomyopathy was thought to be
due to lupus.  Peripartum cardiomyopathy was also considered
however given the timing of onset and biopsy showing immune
complexes seen on endocardial biopsy, lupus cardiomyopathy was
thought to be more likely.  She was treated with steroids,
cytoxan, plasmaphoresis, IVIG and supportive care, and improved
from an EF of 15 to 33%.  It is unclear which therapy led to
improvement.  She did require temporary CCU transfer for
milrinone given worsening EF, however was weaned after a few
days and transferred back to the floor in stable condition.  Her
mitral regurgitation and hypertension also contributed to her
poor forward flow, and htn improved with diuresis, hydralazine,
lisinopril and amlodipine.
.
#) sCHF, volume overload: On admission, pt was clearly
tachypneic but satting well on room air. Reported 3 pillow
orthopnea and paroxysmal noctural dyspnea, in the setting of
recent d/c Lasix and IVF resuscitation, LE edema also suggested
fluid overload.  BNP extremely elevated at 65,187.  She also had
non-specific sxs concerning for HF including throat tightness
and GI sxs.  Her sxs improved with diuresis and symptomatic
management and she was discharged on oral torsemide.  She was
also treated with BP control and bblocker therapy.  Given her
SOB and LE edema R>L, a LE US was performed and showed no LE
clot, therefore PE was thought to be unlikely.
.
#) SLE. Pt diagnosed in [**2168**], manifested by kidney disease
previously membranous nephropathy, facial rash, Sjogren's
syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, and pleuritis.  Previously
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 68981**] at B&W, however has requested to transfer
her care to [**Hospital1 18**] after this admission.  Initially contined on
Plaquenil and Imuran, as well as prednisone.  Plaquenil dc'd per
rheumatology recs.  Cardiomyopathy and renal failure on current
admission were felt to be manifestation of underlying lupus.
Rheumatology was consulted and recommended aggressive therapy
with steriods, cytoxan and plasmapheresis.  Received solumedrol
1g daily x 3 followed by solumedrol 30mg IV q12hrs, which was
uptitrated to 60 q 12 hrs and subseuquently tapered and she was
ultimately discharged on prednisone 60mg orally daily.  She was
also placed on atovaquone PCP prophylaxis in the setting of
immunosuppression.  She recieved 1 dose of cytoxan 750mg on [**10-20**]
with mesna, cell counts with nadir on [**11-5**].  Prior to cytoxan,
she received 7.5mg Lupron for ovarian protection with plans to
pursue egg harvesting for fertility as an outpatient.  Received
5 cycles of plasmapheresis.  3 doses of IVIG was also
administered given that pts HF continued to worsen during the
hospital stay.  Additional plasmaphoreis was considered but held
due to her continued improvement.
.
#) Nausea/diarrhea. Initially thought secondary to restarting
Imuran, however pt and husband attributed to bblocker therapy.
Most likely due to gut edema in the setting of right HF.  GI was
consulted and agreed however recommended ruling out infectious
etiology given her immunosuppression; w/u was negative. She
improved with symptomatic tx and treatment of her HH.
.
#) thrombocytopenia: Pt bleeding from HD site [**10-21**], improved
with Cryo, Platelets, and Surgicel. Patient developed
thrombocytopenia with nadir of 68, likely multifactorial related
to dilution, imunnosupression, and possibly pheresis.  Heme
consulted and recommended removing ASA, NSAIDs, all heparin
products, f/u LFTs, fibrinogen.  Platelet drop was too quick to
be related to Cytoxan and likelihood of developping 4T score is
3. HIT ab negative. Fibrinogen nomralized. Thrombocytopenia
quickly improved, however then fluctuated in the setting of
cytoxan use.  IgG and IgM ACA negative, so unlikely to have
prothrombotic state.
.
#) Acute on chronic RF: Pt with h/o SLE Nephritis. Pt previously
with membranous nephropathy on prior biopsy.  She had repeat
biopsy showing type 3,4,5 lupus nephritis.  Worsening renal
failure with creatinine increased to 3.7 up from 1.4 on
admission.  Urine lytes indicative of prerenal ischemia (FeUrea
< 0.02%) +/- evolving ATN  likely from poor cardiac output/
cardiorenal syndrome.  renal U/S show's no obstruction.   While
her renal function showed some initial worsening with diuresis,
diuresis was continued due to continued volume overload, and
creatinine remained stable.
.
# HTN: BPs improved with uptitration of hydralazine and addition
of lisinopril.  Pt concerned that hydralazine may be causing
joint pain.  Given this and her improved renal function,
lisinopril was uptitrated and hydralazine discontinued.  Blood
pressures stable
.
# Anemia:  Likely due to acute renal disease, cytoxan therapy.
Pt was given one unit of PRBCs while in patient and started on
epo with good improvement in her crit.
.
# Joint pain: ? medication side effect (IVIG, hydralazine) vs
lupus flare, however pt has never had joint pain with lupus
flares in the past.  Hydralazine was discontinued, symptomatic
relief with tylenol, PT.
