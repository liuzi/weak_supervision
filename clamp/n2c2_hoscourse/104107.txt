Mr. [**Known lastname 30842**] was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery service under the
care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Given his low platelet counts (74) at
[**Hospital1 **] and at [**Hospital1 18**], a hematology consult was obtained for
further evaluation.  His thrombocytopenia had been previously
documented and worked up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30843**].  An abdominal ultrasound
showed no signs of splenomegaly and his heparin-dependent
antibody assay was negative.  In addition, the Hepatology team
was asked to evaluate Mr. [**Known lastname 30842**] for his thrombocytopenia in the
presence of HCV.  On [**12-12**], Mr. [**Known lastname 30842**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an
ultrasound-guided liver biopsy.  The results were mild portal
chronic, predominantly mononuclear cell, inflammation; and
focal, mild steatosis.

Mr. [**Known lastname 30842**] was cleared for surgery by the Hematology and
Hepatology teams.  His chronic thrombocytopenia was attributed
to either ITP or HCV.  He received platelet transfusions
pre-operatively.  On [**12-18**], he [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] his CABG x1 and AVR
without complications.  Please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 5572**] Operative Note
for further detail.

Post-operatively, he did well.  He was extubated, his chest
tubes removed, and transferred to the floor by POD #2.  His
platelet and hematocrit levels were closely followed.  By the
time of discharge on POD #5, his epicardial wires were removed,
he was evaluated by physical therapy, had good pain control, and
was tolerating a regular diet, although complained of poor
appetite.  His Coumadin was restarted on [**12-20**] for his atrial
fibrillation.
