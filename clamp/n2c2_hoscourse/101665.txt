This is a 39 year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy,
chronic aspiration, GERD who presents with fevers, cough,
abdominal pain, and diarrhea with persistent hypotension.
.
Plan:
# Hypotension - on initial admit, febrile, tachycardic, and had
leukocytosis.  Potential likely sources included LLL pneumonia
with infiltrate on CXR, c.diff given diarrhea and recent abx
exposure.  Other possible causes are prostate though no specific
findings on exam. urine clear. no clear reason to suspect
meningitis (no neck stiffness than baseline per mother).  GI was
consulted.  Family deferred CVL; team discussed risks of
dopamine peripherally.  Dopamine was initially given for ~10
hours to maintian MAPs>60.  Pt was initially treated for
possible aspiration pna and cdiff with vanco, gentamicin, and
flagyl.  On hospital day #2, gentamicin and vancomycin were
discontinued and flaygl was continued as the infiltrates on cxr
were not felt to be the active site of infection.  Patient did
not have evidence of c.diff and was discontinued.  The patient
clinically improved and was discharged home on loperamide.
.
# Hypotension: as above, thought likely component of
dehydration, medication effect from meds given in the ED and
infection.  Pt was treated with IVF and initially with dopamine.
 Hemodynamics were stabilized.
.
# Abd pain/gerd:  CT scan ruled out acute pathology, suggested
duodenitis.  CXR suggested possible chronic aspiration.  Pt
remained on his at-home PPI and H2 blocker.  He was restarted on
his TFs via G-tube on hospital day #2.
.
# Seizure d/o: continued home phenobarb and diazepam
