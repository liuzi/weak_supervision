52 year old female with a history of lone atrial fibrillation
and Lyme meningitis presenting with progressive shortness of
breath and DOE over past 2 weeks admitted to the MICU with
pleural effusions and a pericardial effusion in the setting of
presumed viral pleurisy and pericarditis that developed into an
effusion after chronic NSAID use possible aspiration/CAP PNA who
developed AFIB with RVR secondary to pain and pericardial
effusion, transaminitis with cholestasis and acute renal failure
in the setting of anemia and NSAID use who has a persistent O2
requirement with pleuritic pain and resolving pericardial
effusion.  She improved clinically prior to discharge after CT
placement for her L effusion and a thoracentesis to remove her R
sided pleural effusion.
.
# SOB/CP/hypoxia: Likely multifactorial with most obvious
etiologies being pleural, pericardial effusions, and . PE was
less likely given [**5-23**] CTA negative. Due to her effusions, it was
thought she may have an underlying PNA and she was started on
levaquin for CAP.  She was given a prolonged course due to
concern that she may have had infection in her pericardial
fluid.  The day after admission ([**6-7**]) she was intubated for
hemodynamic control(Afib RVR 150s), pain control, and for
potential procedure for a possible pericardial window.  From a
respiratory prospective she was comfortable prior to intubation
which was done under rapid sequence given signs of early
tamponade.  She was extubated without event when it was
determined that cardiology did not think her pericardal effusion
needed to be drained.  Instead, cardiology recommended serial
Echo's to follow the effusions size.  An echo on [**6-14**] showed
that the effusion was reduced in size compared to prior imaging.
.
#Afib with RVR: The Patient has a history of lone atrial
fibrillation. On day of admission patient went to Afib to 200s
briefly sustaining in the 160s.  This was thought [**2-23**] to pain
and infection vs tamponade physiology.  She received metroprolol
IV and dilt drip. When patient was intubated, she converted back
to sinus rhythm and maintained in sinus rhythm.  After
extubation and while on the floor the patient did not have any
palpitations or further episodes of Afib wtih RVR.
- She will need to discuss with her outpatient physician
[**Name9 (PRE) **] with aspirin when her pericardial effusion
resolves.
.
# Pleural Effusions: She presented with pleuritic chest pain
which was initially attributed to her pleural effusions.
Initially, the DDx was broad including infectious(Lyme/parvo
negative, [**Location (un) **] pending), malignant(cytology ultimately
negative), and rheumatologic([**Doctor First Name **] negative and C3/C4 normal). CHF
and cirrhosis unlikely based on H+P. Lipase normal makes
pancreatits unlikely. Thoracentesis reveals exudate, likely
parapneumonic given fevers, and a viral pleuritis was also
considered.  ID was consulted who recommended empiric coverage
for CAP with a prolonged course of Levofloxacin (14 days -
finish on [**6-20**]) due to a concern that the pericardial fluid
could [**Hospital1 **] infection.  Cytology negative, cultures negative.
Morphine and fentanyl pleuritic CP. The most likely diagnosis
was a viral infection with a superimposed bacterial process
possibly in the setting of aspiration 1 week prior.  Of note her
effusions persisted despite antibiotic therapy and NSAID
therapy.  She was given diuretics with lasix which did not
reduced the size of her effusion.  Therefore, a L sided chest
tube placement by IP in addition to a right sided thoracentesis.
 After subsequent removal of her bilateral pleural effusions,
her symptoms of SOB and O2 requirement resolved.
.
# Pericardial Effusion: Initially echo concerning for early but
not overt tamponade physiology and exam was concerning. Patient
was given IVF to maintain preload. Serologies were sent as
above. Her pulsus was monitored closely and was never above
12mmHG. Cardiology consult followed closely and serial echos
showed improvement in effusions. The decision was made not to
drain effusions for diagnostic purposes given the risks
involved.  She was restarted on NSAID therapy for viral
pericarditis.  Of note, her effusion improved by echo prior to
discharge.
.
# CAP:  Given her exudative effusion and viral pleuritis there
was concern for CAP and possible aspiration.  She was given a
two week course of levofloxacin to finish on the date listed
above.
.
# Diarrhea:  She had transient episode of diarrhea while on
antibiotics, and her diarrhea resolved.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]/Low UO: Dark urine and poor output early in ICU course.
Thought potentially from NSAIDs. Renal spun urine and it was not
active.  She had low UOP, which improved with IVF.
.
Cholestasis and Hepatitis:  She was noted to have to have
abnormal LFT's with cholestatsis in addition to pleuritic R
sided abdominal pain.  There was concern that she could have
either a viral induced hepatitis with cholestasis versus a
congestive hepatopathy in the setting of mild volume overload.
Cholecystitis was less likely given the absence of a white
count.  Her LFT's trended down independent of diuresis thereby
suggesting/confirming a possible viral etiology for her
hepatitis and cholestasis.  Of note her hepatitis serologies
were negative.
.
# Anemia: Baseline hct 40s most recently in [**2171**]. No signs or
symptoms of bleeding. Likely from systemic process going on.
Normal colonoscopy in [**2171**]. Of note, she is currently
menopausal, and has iron studies that suggest she has anemia of
chronic disease, or at least anemia with acute inflammation.
- She will need a CBC as an outpatient.
