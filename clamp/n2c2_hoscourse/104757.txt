81yo male with history of rheumatic heart disease s/p St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1525**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1291**] and tissue MVR in [**6-/2125**], afib on coumadin, and systolic
heart failure who presented to ED from rehab with
lethargy/altered mental status.

#. Respiratory Failure: Patient developed acute hypercarbic
respiratory failure secondary to lorazepam administration in ED.
 He was transferred to ICU for further care, but did not require
intubation. He has severe OSA, and was seen by sleep medicine
while in ICU. Unable to complete study as patient could not
tolerate BiPAP, but patient will need sleep medicine follow-up
and repeat sleep study as outpatient.  The patient's respiratory
status improved, and he was stable for transfer to the floor on
[**2125-9-14**]. The patient was unable to tolerate CPAP, and therefore
was kept on oxygen via nasal cannula at night.  He was not given
any further sedating medications except in the setting of his
TEE.  All sedating meds in the outpatient setting should be
avoided or minimized as possible.
.
#. Enterococcal bacteremia: Blood cultures drawn on admission
positive for enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin and ampicilin.
 He was initially on vancomycin, then switched to
ampicillin/gentamicin per ID consult recommendations.  He
required ampicillin desensitization in ICU setting given his h/o
penicillin allergy. A TEE on [**2125-9-18**] did not reveal the presence
of any valvular vegetations. However, per ID recs the patient
should still complete a course of antibiotics that would treat
endocarditis, especially given his [**Date Range 1291**]/MVR. CT surgery was
following, and there was no need for surgical intervention given
the TEE findings.  The patient will be on ampicillin until
[**2125-10-28**], and gentamicin for synergy until [**2125-9-29**]. He had a PICC
placed on [**2125-9-19**] for continued antibiotic therapy. All
surveillance blood cultures drawn since [**2125-9-12**] were negative to
date at time of discharge.  The patient remained afebrile and
was hemodynamically stable.
.
#. Altered mental status: The patient was found to have
enterococcal bacteremia, and delirium in setting of infection
was likely the primary contributing factor to his altered mental
status.  Also probable contributing factors include chronic CO2
retention, severe OSA, medication effects, and prolonged
hospital course.  Head CT on admission did not show any acute
intracranial process. No other source of infection, including
PNA or UTI, was identified. At time of discharge, patient's
mental status continued to wax and wane. He was oriented to
person and place, and able to follow some commands.
.
#. s/p St. [**Initials (NamePattern4) 1525**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1291**] and tissue MVR: Given valves, goal INR is
2.5-3.5. The patient's INR was trended and coumadin dose was
adjusted accordingly. Coumadin held for period in setting of
supratherapeutic INR, then restarted. INR was also briefly
subtherapeutic, and patient was placed on heparin gtt during
this time to bridge back to a therapeutic INR on coumadin.  INR
was at goal (2.5) on day of discharge, and heparin gtt had been
stopped. INR should continue to be monitored, and coumadin dose
adjusted accordinly. As above, no evidence of valvular
vegetations was seen on TEE [**2125-9-18**].
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Patient's home dose of metoprolol was
titrated up to 100mg PO TID, given frequent episodes of
tachycardia to 120s. Patient was asymptomatic and
hemodynamically stable during these episodes.  He was continued
on coumadin as above for both his a fib and [**Month/Day/Year 1291**]/MVR.
.
#. Chronic systolic heart failure: TTE on [**2125-9-14**] showed LVEF of
30-35%. Patient appeared euvolemic for much of hospital course.
He was on furosemide 20mg daily prior to admission, and this
medication should be restarted in outpatient setting if patient
develops hypervolemia and pulmonary edema. Patient was continued
on ACE inhibitor and beta blocker. Lisinopril dose is currently
5mg daily, this can be up-titrated if BP will allow in
outpatient setting.
.
#. Hypertension:  The patient was continued on metoprolol,
lisinopril as above. Furosemide may be restarted as outpatient
if patient develops hypervolemia or becomes more hypertensive.
.
#. Hyperlidipemia: The patient was on simvastatin 10mg daily
prior to admission, and this was re-started prior to discharge.
This medication was briefly held in setting of elevated
transaminases, however was resumed as transaminases trended down
to normal levels. Etiology of elevation in transaminases
unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 5283**] US on [**2125-9-13**] was unremarkable.
.
#. Nutrition: Patient has PEG tube in place, but has not been
using since prior to admission. He is able to tolerate PO
intake, but should be monitored on aspiration precautions.
