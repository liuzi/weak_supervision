71 M with AS (0.8) and One vessel CAD p/w resp. distress that
prompted intubation. He is presently hypotensive, tachycardic
and profoundly hypoxic.
.
ACUTE ISSUES:
# Hypoxia - Patient arrived intubated after presenting to OSH
with SOB. Bilateral pulm infiltrates were severe and most
radiologically c/w pulm edema. However, the patient had fluid
responsive tachycardia and a low CVP (through the PICC). His
resp distress progressed despite lasix diuresis at NVMC.
Accordingly, initial differential included ARDS from sepsis (see
below), DAD, multifocal pna, flash pulmonary edema and
daptomycin pneumonitis. He was ventilated with ARDSnet settings.
 Pt was able to be weaned to minimal ventilator settings by day
8 of intubation.  However, extubation was delayed due to pt's
mental status.  Despite holding sedation for several days, pt
remained non-responsive.  He was successfully extubated on day
11 of intubation.  He successfully transitioned from nasal
canula to room air and has an oxygen saturation of 97-100% on
room air at time of discharge.
.
# Hypotension - Inital presentation with low CVP implies poor
preload implicating aortic stenosis as a cause. Tachycardia
improved with fluid boluses supporting poor preload.
Differential also included cardiac event, sepsis, PEEP effect
and propofol. Fluids and pressors were administered with goal
MAP > 60. Palliative valvuloplasty was attempted. TTE showed
post-valvuloplasty aortic valve area of 0.8cm2. He was
pan-cultured and initially continuted on vancomycin (gentomycin
was held given [**Last Name (un) **]).  He was successfully weaned off pressors
and maintained MAP >65.
.
# E. Faecalis infection:  Pt diagnosed with E.Faecalis on
previous admission and was discharged on dapto/gentamycin.  In
interim, pt developed [**Last Name (un) **] that was attributed to gentamycin
toxicity.  Dapto/gent was discontinued and he was started on
vancomycin (vanc sensitivity MIC of 2). Infectious Disease team
was consulted and per their recommendations, vancomycin was
discontinued due to risk of increasing kidney injury.  Pt was
resumed again on daptomycin.  Blood cultures remained negative
during this hospitalization.  He is to complete a 6 week course
of daptomycin for bacteremia (should be discontinued around
[**2120-8-28**] - however exact date of discontinuation should decided
at follow-up ID appointment on [**2120-8-20**]).
.
# UTI: Pt developed fever and leukocytosis during his ICU stay.
A UA demonstrated pyuria, and he grew Proteus resistant to cipro
but sensitive to ceftriaxone. He was started on ceftriaxone 1gm
daily for a 14 day course which should be completed on [**2120-8-29**].
.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  Pt developed new onset paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation during hospitalization with heart rates up to 150s.
 He was rate controlled with IV and PO metoprolol.  He was
loaded with amiodarone and was started on anticoagulation with
heparin and coumadin.  He spontaneously converted back to sinus
rhythm and has remained in sinus for several days without any
recurrence of afib.  He was taken off heparin drip once INR was
theraputic at 2.0-3.0. He should be continued on amio 400 mg PO
daily for 1 week, and then decreased to maintenance dose of amio
200 mg PO daily.  His INR has been theraputic on coumadin 5mg PO
daily.
.
# Renal Failure - Pt presented with acute renal failure, thought
to be secondary to gentamicin use with a creatinine that peaked
at 3.7. Pt' severe respiratory distress was thought to be due to
volume overload so CVVH was initiated.  There were issues of
kinking with the CVVH catheter and the line had to be replaced
two times in order to achieve adequate flow. Pt tolerated CVVH
well with only one episode of hypotension thought to be related
to excessive fluid shifts during the CVVH. CVVH was discontinued
on [**8-5**] when pt began putting out good urine to IV Lasix. By the
end of his stay, pt was euvolemic, his creatinine was trending
down and he no longer required lasix.
.
# Altered Mental Status/Stroke - There was difficulty extubating
patient due to persistent mental status alteration. He was
inconsistently responsive to painful stimuli and failed to
respond to simple commands even though he had been quite alert
and interactive prior to his hospitalization. This altered
mental status was initially attributed to oversedation during
intubation so sedation was withheld for several days without any
improvement in mental status. Concern was then raised for
ischemic stroke given his recent episodes of atrial fibrillation
(see below). On exam, it was noticed that he seemed to had
clonus on his right side and appeared to have gaze preference to
the left. Neurology was consulted who recommended a CT Head and
MRI/MRA of the Head. CT Head showed left parietal hypodensity
extending to the cortex with an appearance of subacute infarct
of few days' duration. Follow-up MRI/MRA confirmed these
findings but also showed diminished flow in the right ICA. F/u
ultrasound of the carotids demonstrated intracranial dissection
on the right but per vascular surgery, no intervention is needed
and he can follow-up with vascular surgery in six months for
interval evaluation of any changes. However, he should be
further evaluated with CTA once his renal function improves.
Most likely etiology of the stroke is thrombus dislodged during
valvuloplasty or during pt's episodic episodes of atrial
fibrillation. After patient was successfully extubated, his
mental status improved significantly. He was alert and able to
follow commands consistently. He had a tremor in his face and
extremities (though this was present at baseline) and pt has an
expressive aphasia, able to answer questions only in short
sentences. Per neurology, pt is now exhibiting symptoms of
Parkinsonism but would defer treatment at this point.
.
# Diabetes: Pt continue to have elevated BG to 300s during ICU
stay.  He required insulin drip to manage his sugars.  [**Hospital **]
Clinic was consulted and pt was started on Lantus 45 units along
with sliding scale insulin as attached.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Aortic stenosis: Prior to admission pt was being evaluated for
CoreValve procedure, however evalution was complicated by
enterococcus infection.  Because of hypotension on presention,
palliative valvuloplasty was attempted but was not successful
because of technical difficulties.  Post-valvuloplasty aortic
area was 0.8cm2.  Volume status was monitored closely during
admission because pt is very preload depended.  Even if deemed
an appropriate candidate, he will not be eligable for CoreValve
for at least 6 months now given acute CVA.
.
# CAD: Pt continued on aspirin, metoprolol, and rosuvastatin
during hospitalization.
.
# Hypertension: Pt resumed on metoprolol once hypotension
resolved.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continue Rosuvastatin
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
He remained full code this admission.  Acute parietal infarct
has left pt with many residual deficits and will require intense
rehab and close follow-up with many specialties.
