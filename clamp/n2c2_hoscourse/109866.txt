Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital, kept NPO and hydrated
with IV fluids. Based on his symptoms and anatomy, repair of his
large paraesophageal hernia was recommended.  Unfortunately he
became delirious after having low dose Ativan which was given
preoperatively to reduce his anxiety.  He was taken to the
Operating Room for surgery on [**2130-3-15**] but immediately refused
the surgery when he arrived in the Operating Room. He appeared
confused and delirious, the surgery was cancelled and he
returned to the floor.

The Psychiatry service evaluated him and felt that the confusion
and delirium was prompted by Ativan in combination with poor
nutritional status and his age. At that point the patient wanted
surgery again.  A decision was made to place a PICC line and
give TPN for 4-5 days prior to operating with the attempt to
help improve his nutritional status.  A PICC line was placed on
[**2130-3-16**] and TPN began.

In the mean time he worked with Physical Therapy and had no more
episodes of confusion or delirium.

On [**2130-3-20**] he was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a
laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair with PEG tube
placement. He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the
PACU in stable condition.  He maintained stable hemodynamics and
his pain was well controlled.  Following transfer to the
Surgical floor he continued to make good progress.  His pain was
controlled with Tylenol alone and his mental status was intact.
His TPN continued and eventually tube feedings were started and
well tolerated.  He was maintained on 2 cal HN 1 can TID.  His
TPN was weaned off [**2130-3-23**] and his PICC line was removed.

His chest xray on admission to the hospital was notable for
bilateral pleural effusions but his respiratory status was not
compromised.  His effusions did increase in size and on [**2130-3-23**]
he has a left thoracentesis for 1 liter of serosanguinous fluid.
 He tolerated it well and his subsequent chest xray demonstrated
no pneumothorax and a clear diaphram.  He was breathing
comfortably off of oxygen and had room air saturations of 95%.

He continued to work with Physical Therapy who recommended that
he go to a short term rehab prior to returning home to increase
his mobility and endurance.  From a surgical standpoint he
continued to do well.  His post sites were healing well and his
PEG site was dry.  After a long hospital stay he was discharged
to rehab on [**2130-3-24**].
