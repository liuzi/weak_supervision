Patient is an 84 year old female with mild dementia,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus type two, and bipolar disease,
who presented on [**2186-10-11**] from [**Hospital3 **] with failure to
thrive, and was being worked up for renal failure and balancing
hypertension medications, who was found by nursing staff to be
'unresponsive' with no breathing or radial pulse for 20 seconds
and transferred to intensive care unit.
.
# Unresponsive episodes -
Patient had initial episode of unresponsiveness, and additional
episodes witnessed by the intensive care team. There was concern
for seizure activity, given complete unresponsiveness to verbal
and tactile stimuli, then confusion and return to baseline after
episode. Given her diabetes and her labile blood pressure,
autonomic seizures were of particular concern, as was complete
heart block (given known RBBB with LAFB) however telemetry
tracings remained within normal limits. It was also concerning
that her medications could be playing role. She was monitored on
telemetry which was unrevealing for a cause, a transthoracic
echo did not reveal clear cause, nor did continuous EEG
monitoring. Several of her blood pressure medications were held
to avoid hypotensive episodes, which ultimately felt to be the a
large part of the cause.
She had no further episodes after her first transfer out of the
intensive care unit on [**2186-10-17**].
.
# Hypertension - Patient has historically difficult to control
blood pressure, with typical systolic blood pressure of 180's as
an outpatient. An abdominal bruit was appreciated on exam. A
renal ultarsound showed bilateral flow with doplers. Imaging
with captopril was obtained to further evaluate for renal artery
stenosis, and was within normal limits. A work up for other
secondary causes was initiated, including hyperaldosterone,
hyper-renin, hyper-ACTH, and pheochromocytoma. Her work up
revealed slightly elevated normetanephrine in serum and urine,
as well as very mildly elevated epinephrine, norepinephrine,
dopamine, and catecholamines; it was not felt that these were
consistent with a pheochromocytoma. An AM cortisol was found to
be elevated and resistant to supression by 1mg dexamethasone
overnight. Because of that, a CT abdomen/pelvis was obtained on
[**2186-10-26**] to look for source of Cushings syndrome or ectopic
ACTH secretion-- it showed inflammation around the duodenum and
head of the pancreas but no adrenal masses.
.
Her blood pressure medications were slowly re-introduced, to
avoid hypotension, with goal systolic blood pressure greater
than 130's to 140's.
.
At time of discharge, her blood pressure medications were:
- Metoprolol 100 mg q8 hours
- Clonidine TTS 2 patch weekly
- Captopril 75 mg q8 hours
.
# Arrythmias: Cardiology was consulted early in her stay after
episodes of V-[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and PVCs. It was recommended to
continue rate control metoprolol, as well as continue her ACE-I.
Electrophysiology was asked to see patient again on [**2186-10-22**]
for repeated episodes of V-[**Year (4 digits) **]. At that time, amiodarone was
initiated at 200 TID,
tapered to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-1**], and finally continued at 200 mg
daily since [**2186-11-14**].  She had no further arrythmias noted.
.
# Renal insufficiency - Upon admission, she had worsening of her
renal function with a creatinine to 1.7. It was felt that her
renal insufficiency was pre-renal in nature, and she was given
gentle intravenous fluids. It was thought she had an element of
diabetic nephropathy as well. The renal team was consulted and
assisted with management of her care. Her creatinine rose to 2.0
at its peak, coinciding with her hypotensive episodes. At time
of discharge,  her renal function was stable at 0.8-1.2, and she
continued to put out good amounts of urine..
.
# Type two diabetes mellitus - Patient was on glipizide at home,
however with her worsening renal function and very little PO
intake, a sliding scale of insulin was started, and basal
insulin was added as needed.
At time of discharge, she was on 30 units of lantus in addition
to a humalong sliding scale.
.
# Hypothyroidism - Patient has history of thyroid carcinoma and
is status-post thyroidectomy. At time of admission, her TSH was
very suppressed, but her free T4 level was within normal limits.
Her TSH rose during her stay, peaking at 32. Her T4 studies were
found to be low. Endocrine consultation was obtained to assist
with management of her thyroid disease, especially with
concurrent use of amiodarone and lithium. Her dose of
levothyroxine was increased to 300 mcg for several days, then
brought down to 175 mcg prior to discharge.  Her TSH remained
elevated (15) on a subsequent check on [**12-13**].  This was associated
with a normal free T4 (1.5).  After discussion with
endocrinology, it was felt that she may not be absorbing well
and may be becoming progressively more hypothyroid.  Her tube
feeds should be held 30 minutes before and after administering
synthroid; she should have her levels followed to ensure that
this is effective.  If she is still underreplaced, she may need
to have IV levothyroxine.
- Her thyroid function tests should be checked and followed up
1-2 weeks after discharge.
- An ultrasound of her thyroid was checked to assess for any
thyroid disease or cancer recurrence in light of her elevated
TSH. The ultrasound was unchanged from prior studies.
.
# Upper gastrointestinal bleed: On [**2186-11-4**] patient developed
a decline in her hematocrit to 19, with guaiac positive stools,
then melena and bright red blood per rectum. She was transferred
to the intensive care unit, and gastroenterology was consulted.
An upper endoscopy revealed bleeding duodenal ulcers that were
injected and cauterized. She required a total of 9 units of
packed red blood cells during her intensive care stay.
Her hematocrit remained relatively stable after her transfer
back to the general floors on [**2186-11-8**], until [**2186-11-15**], at
which time her hematocrit continued to drift downward and her
stools were guaiac positive. Plans were made for a colonoscopy,
however, in light of an additional hematocrit drop to 20, a
repeat endoscopy was completed on [**2186-11-17**], and a new third
duodenal ulcer was noted which was also treated. She received
two additional units of red blood cells.
.
Testing for h. pylori was negative, and gastrin levels were
elevated; the elevated gastrin levels were expected in setting
of PPI use, and endocrine consultation did not feel there was
any additional pathology contributing to the elevated gastrin
levels.
- [**Hospital1 **] PPI was initiated and should be continued for at least 4
additional weeks, then continued daily.
- Patient will need follow up with gastroenterology after
discharge, for possible further evaluation of nodules seen
during her first endoscopy.
.
# C. Difficile Colitis: Patient developed diarrhea on
[**2186-11-24**], and stool samples revealed c. difficile. She was
initiated on treatment with flagyl on [**2186-11-25**], however was
refusing oral medications, so intravenous flagyl was
administered until [**2186-12-2**] at which time she could receive
oral medications via her PEG.
She did not have any abdominal pain or distention.
Her white blood cell count bumped to >20 at the time of her c.
difficile infection.  Then improved.  Around [**12-5**] her WBC count
again increased, with no other clear etiology found.  It was
decided to change flagyl back to IV, and to add PO vanco.  The
plan is to continue IV flagyl and PO vanco until about a week
after WBC stopping other antibiotics (cipro for UTI).
.
# Bipolar Disorder:
Patient had recent hospitalization for manic episode at outside
hospital. She has long standing history of depression and manic
episodes, with numerous prior psychiatric admissions. Her family
gave history that many of her prior depressive episodes had
started with refusal to eat.
.
Psychiatry team was consulted at the start of her stay and
followed along the entire time. Therapeutic options for her
bipolar disease were limited given her multiple serious medical
co-morbidities. There was concern during her stay for seizures
and serotonin syndrome, however neither was felt to have taken
place. She was titrated upward on citalopram to 40 mg (increased
from 20 mg on [**2186-11-24**] and increased from 30mg on [**2186-12-11**]).
Given her prior success on lithium, which had been stopped due
to "toxicity" of unclear etiology, the decision was made to
re-introduce lithium while in the inpatient setting where the
patient could be carefully monitored. 150 mg qHS was started on
[**2186-11-8**], and levels were closely followed, with goal level
about 0.5.
.
ECT: Psychiatry felt that one of the best options would be ECT,
however the patient continued to adamantly voice her refusal.
Several family meetings took place with her primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], primary medical, and psychiatric teams to
discuss various options for her severe depression, which was
felt to be the main reason for her failure to thrive and poor PO
intake.
Given her refusal to ECT, legal guardianship would need to be
pursued if the patient's family desired to pursue ECT and it was
necessary to deem the patient incompetent to make a decision
regarding ECT due to her depression.
- Remeron was considered, but contraindicated with use of
clonidine.
- Rilatin was also considered, but contraindicated with her
cardiac arrhythmias.
- Patient will need continued follow up with psychiatry as an
outpatient.
.
At time of discharge, the patient's mood and affect had improved
greatly since her initial presentation, and she appeared much
less flat. She was answering questions with complete sentences
with improved, though still limited, range of emotions.
.
# Failure to thrive/Anorexia - Patient continued to refuse to
eat and take her medications during most of her stay. As her
medical problems cleared, she became more interactive and
started to eat small amounts and take her medications. After
much discussion and a trial of one week once medically stable to
improve PO intake, decision was made to place PEG tube, which
was completed on [**2186-12-1**].
- Physical therapy and occupational therapy were consulted and
followed along during the patient's stay.
- Thyroid management as detailed above.
.
# Dementia: Patient has history of mild dementia. She was
initially on Namenda, however it was held due to her
unresponsive episodes, contribution to hypertension, and
possible serotonin syndrome.
.
# Tachypnea: Patient had intermittent episodes of increased
respiratory rate, ranging 25 - 30. Her oxygenation remained
normal, and her lungs were clear, and she denied any complaints.
Several chest x-rays were unrevealing. Her tachypnea improved
overall, but she would occasionally have episodes of increased
respiratory rate when aroused, agitated (eg by asking several
questions).
.
# Acalculus Cholecystitis:
A RUQ US showed possible GB wall necrosis and microperforation.
Surgery was consulted and recommended a percutaneous GB tube,
which was placed on [**2186-10-27**].  It was assumed that this was
the source of her persistent leukocytosis, since her WBC fell to
15 after placement of the tube, but the WBC has since increased.
 On [**10-28**] after the procedure, levo/flagyl was switched to zosyn
for better gram negative coverage.  Vanco was continued.
Throughout all this, she has had no fevers, denies abdominal
pain and has a relatively benign abd exam w/ no guarding,
rebound or RUQ tenderness.  Surgery strongly feels that she does
not have an "acute abdmonial process" and they want to revisit
the idea of an elective cholecystectomy in [**3-18**] weeks.  However,
it seems most likely that the necrotic GB was the course of the
persistent leukocytosis.
- Her drain site remained clean, dry, and intact.
- Several cultures from her bile drain were without growth
except for one that haad coagulase negative staph, felt to be a
contaminant.
- Patient's percutaneous gall bladder drain was clamped on [**12-8**]
and removed on [**2186-12-11**].
.
# Conjunctivitis: Patient completed course of treatment with
erythromycin eye drops.
.
# Oral Thrush: Patient occasionally had evidence of white
exudate on her tongue, which was possibly thrush given her very
poor PO intake and refusal of mouth care ans swabs. It was
possible that thrush was also contributing to her lack of
appetite.
- Nystatin S+S was initiated.  It can be given on a prn basis
for recurrence.
.
# Elevated Cardiac Enzymes: Patient's cardiac enzymes bumped
slightly in setting of her gastrointestinal bleed and relative
hypotension. She had no chest pain or EKG changes, and it was
felt that she had an episode of demand ischemia.
.
# Tranaminitis: Patient's transaminases were elevated into the
[**2178**], which occurred following her gastrointestinal bleed and
episode of relative hypotension when her systolic blood pressure
was into the 100s in setting of bleed. It was suspected that she
suffered from ischemic process (CEs also bumped) due to
hypotension. She had also  been getting tylenol during her
during intensive care stay, but not greater than 2 grams per
day.
- A RUQ US was obtained to rule out thrombosis or other process
was completed without any apparent new pathology.
.
# Thrombocytopenia- Patient developed thrombocytopenia down to
127 at the lowest. This resolved during her stay, and it was
thought to be due to her poor nutritional status.
- There were no clear offending medications on her medication
list.
- HIT testing was negative.
.
# Leukocytosis, fevers: Patient had fevers and leukocytosis
intermittently during her stay. Patient's fevers have resolved,
but she has had continued leukocytosis.  Patient had definite
spike to > 20 with c. difficle infection.
- Patient had multiple sets of blood, urine, stool, and bile
cultures drawn; her chest x-ray was unchanged.
.
# Anemia: As discussed above in regards to GIB. Her hematocrit
remained stable at 26-28 range prior to discharge. Her anemia
was that of chronic disease as well as losses from GI tract.
.
# Urinary retention: Patient had several voiding trials with
removal of her foley with persistent urinary retention. There
were no clear offending medications.
- Foley replaced.
- Patient may need follow up with urology to further management
of her foley and retention.  She will  be discharged with foley
in place.
.
# Tremor: Patient had intermittent tremor of her left arm and
bilateral feet, which was stable. It was not present except when
asked several questions and stimulated. Does not cause patient
any distress. Tremor only present when patient stimulated or
agitated, not present in sleep or when calm. No other evidence
of toxicity or increased tone.
