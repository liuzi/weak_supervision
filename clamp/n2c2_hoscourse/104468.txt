87 yo female with h/o anemia, dementia and afib presents with
bradycardia and hypotension that improved with atropine.
.
*Bradycardia: This is likely due to high doses of 2 nodal
blocking agents, the doses of which have been increased in the
past few weeks. She was hypotensive on admission, this was
likely due to her bradycardia and resolved with normalization of
her heartrate. Dig level not elevated, cardiac enzymes negative,
potassium level was normal.  Her diltiazem was discontinued and
the dose of her metoprolol was cut in half.  The doses of these
medication will need to be titrated at rehab.
.
*Afib: Pt with history of afib but EKG c/w aflutter with
variable conduction on admission. Medication doses adjusted as
above.  Coumadin continued with goal INR [**2-10**]
.
* Renal insufficiency: Cr elevated at 1.4 from baseline of 0.8-1
on admission; this resolved with improvement in heartrate
overnight and was back to baseline at 1.0 on discharge.

slighly low.  Levothyroxine dose increase.  Needs repeat TFT's
