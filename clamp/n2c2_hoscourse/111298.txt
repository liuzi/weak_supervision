Patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after having an MRI of her
brain for consistent headaches as an outpatient which showed her
to have a right frontal mass which communicated with the right
lateral ventricle. She was evaluated by neuromedicine and
neurosurgery in the ED and was admitted to the neurosurgery
service. A CTA/V was obtained to gain information on the
vascularity of the mass. On the evening of [**10-10**] it was decided
that she would undergo surgical resection of the mass via
craniotomy on the morning of [**10-11**].  She remained stable on the
floor overnight and on [**10-11**] was taken to the OR for surgery.
Surgery was without complication. She was admitted to the ICU
but remained in the PACU overnight. Post op CT revealed good
resection and no hemorrhage.
ON POD#1 she was neurologically intact. She was cleared for
transfer to the floor. post op MRI was completed and also
revealed excellent resection. PCA was discontinued and she was
started on PO pain meds with IV for breakthourgh. She did
require some IV pain medication on [**10-13**] and remained on her PO
regimen. She was able to mobilize OOB on this day and walk
through the halls without difficulty. She was somewhat
orthostatic and complained of dizziness on [**10-14**] when ambulating
and she was started on 50cc/hr of IVF and had no further issues.


She was discharged to home on [**2164-10-15**].
