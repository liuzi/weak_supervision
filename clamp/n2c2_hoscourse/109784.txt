[**Known firstname 553**] [**Known lastname 1806**] is a 56 year-old woman with a history of
insulin-dependent DMII, bipolar disorder, and psoriatic
arthritis who presents with altered mental status, acute kidney
injury, and elevated lithium levels.

# Altered mental status: Altered mental status most likely cause
by lithium toxicity in the setting of acute kidney injury. No
evidence of infection on UA, no fever or leukocytosis. She has a
history of AMS with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states, but her
hyperglycemia was relatively mild and her serum osmolarity was
normal.  Toxicology initially recommended dialysis, but
nephrology recommended trying aggressive diuresis before
dialyzing the patient, who said that she would refuse a dialysis
catheter. Lithium was held, [**Known lastname **] was held and she was
hydrated agressively with LR, since patient has received 6 L NS
and developed a hyperchloremic acidosis. Lithium levels were
checked Q6hours and she was discharged when Lithium levels
returned to [**Location 213**]

# Acute kidney injury: Her creatinine was elevated to 1.3 from a
baseline of 0.7 on admission.  This was thought to be most
likely intrinsic from TMP/SMX usage, but there she may have had
prerenal physiology as well due to decreased PO intake.  There
was no evidence of obstruction or infection. [**Location **] and
[**Location **] were held, she was hydrated and electrolytes were
followed.

# Diabetes mellitus: Chronic issue which was stable during
admission. She was kept on her sliding scale insulin, metformin
was held. She refused to take her long acting insulin

# Psoriatic arthritis: Symptoms were stable.  She can continue
taking her Methotrexate and Enbrel as an outpatient

# Hypothyroidism: Chronic, stable. Continued home levothyroxine.

# Bipolar and anxiety disorders: Chronic, stable.  She has no
mood symptoms and her altered mental status is not at all
consistent with mania or depression.  We continued her home
benzodiazepines and held lithium in the setting of acute
toxicity.

# Anemia: Initial hematocrit was normal, but that may be in the
setting of hemoconcentration.  No evidence of acute bleeding.
Stool Guiac was negative and serial crits were stable.
