36 y/o female aditted through the ED with loose stools and most
recently BRBPR. She was admitted directly from the ED to the
SICU.
A CT was obtained but without contrast there was no large fluid
collection or hematoma visualized. The assessment of the
pancreatic transplant is limited; however, there are no gross
fluid collections or inflammatory changes present.
Also seen is abdominal rectus diastasis with paraumbilical
hernia containing a single loop of herniated bowel, with no
evidence of bowel obstruction.
She received large volume resuscitation, and 2 units of RBC's on
[**5-3**] for hct 21% and then 2 units RBCs on [**5-4**] for 26%.
Following these transfusions her hematocrit remained stable and
the rectal bleeding had ceased.
On [**5-4**] a tagged Red cell scan was performed, and this did not
show evidence of active bleeding.
Blood cultures collected on admission and then during the
hospitalization were all negative.
CMV viral load and CMV antibody are both negative.
Stool culture, O&P and C diff x 3 were collected and were all
negative.
The patient continued to have multiple loose stools.
She was consulted to the GI service who performed a colonoscopy.
The results were: Normal mucosa in the colon and terminal ileum
with cold forceps biopsies taken wich were not finalized at
discharge. She also had Grade 3 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum.
She was started on immodium which helped decrease number of
stools.
Immunosuppression was changed during this hopsitalization. She
was discontinued off Cellcept, and  after a few days of
monotherapy on Prograf, she was started on imuran, for which she
received a script for home.
She was taken off valcyte after it was determined her CMV status
was negative, and she is out approximately 3 months from
transplant.
ID consult had been obtained early in hospital course. They
followed with antibiotic recommendations, and suggestions
regarding neutropenia. She was initially covered with Levaquin,
Vanco and Flagyl, this was eventually trimmed to Flagyl only and
then no antibiotics for home were recommended.
She was also profoundly neutropenic, and part of adjusting
medications was goal of increasing WBCs as well as 7 days of
Filgrastim. WBC nadir was 0.2.
Upon discharge her stools had been mnimized, immunosuppression
was adjusted and she was tolerating diet.
She has also been followed by social work who will also be
following her as an outpatient due to concerns that she needs
encouragement to call earlier when not feeling well.
