50 year old female with history of HTN and nephrolithiasis,
transferred from outside hospital with fulminant liver failure
and acute on chronic renal failure, admitted to the MICU.
Briefly, her liver failure had almost resolved by the time of
discharge.  The etiology still remains unclear, though zithromax
was felt to be the most likely cause.  Her renal failure
continued, and she was discharged with anticipation of dialysis
in the near future.  The cause of her renal failure also remains
unclear.

1) Liver failure:  On admission, she was found to have
transaminases in the 8000 range, as well as INR 3.8, PT 24.5,
albumin 3.0, Total bili 9.2, and LDH 12,610. She was admitted to
the MICU and followed by the hepatology team.  A number of blood
tests were sent off to ascertain the etiology of her liver
failure, however they were uniformly negative (these included
tylenol, [**Doctor First Name **], CMV, EBV, toxoplasma, Hepatitis serologies,
leptospirosis, and porphyria).  She underwent a transjugular
liver biopsy on the 3rd day of the admission, which showed a
non-specific pattern of injury consistent with drug/toxic or
ischemic disease.

She unfortunately developed a subcapsular liver hematoma during
the procedure, however this was stabilized with FFP and Vitamin
K which the patient had already been receiving.  She also
received 2 U PRBC, and hematocrit was subsequently stable.  A
repeat abdominal CT scan later in the course demonstrated
resolution of the hematoma.

She was followed by the transplant service, however she never
met criteria for liver transplant (no encephalopathy), and liver
function began to improve remarkably (see below).

During her hospitalization she received more than 14 units of
FFP to keep her INR < 1.5, as well as DDAVP x 5, and multiple
dosese of vitamin K.  Prior to discharge, her INR had remained <
1.5 on it's own for > 48 hours.  Her transaminases had trended
down almost into the normal range (111 and 41 for ALT and AST
respectively), and her total bilirubin had trended down to 5.9
from a peak of 40.3.  The etiology of the liver insult remains
unclear, however the zithromax course that she had received is a
potential [**Doctor Last Name 360**], and she should therefore not receive zithromax
in the future.  The hepatology team felt that she would likely
return to completely normal liver function.

2) Acute on chronic renal failure:  On admission she was also in
acute renal failure with creatinine of 5.7.  By report from the
outside hospital, her recent baseline Cr was 2.8 in [**8-4**].
Hepatorenal syndrome was in the differential, however her urine
sodium was elevated, therefore this diagnosis could not be made.
 Initial urine sediment was felt to be consistent with ATN or
AIN (RBCs, no acanthocytes, occasional WBC, hyaline casts,
occasional renal tubular epithelial cells, granular casts, no
muddy brown casts or rbc casts).  A renal US revealed echogenic
kidneys consistent with parenchymal disease.  A later urine
sediment showed many acanthocytic and dysmorphic rbcs, many
casts, granular and bite stained, no WBCs, no RBC casts,
occasional RTE cells, and 100 mg/dl protein.  The nephrology
team felt that her acute insult had resolved, and the new
sediment was suggestive of underlying glomerular injury, the
possibilities for which included cryoglobulinemia, lupus,
endocarditis, idiopathic MPGN, and post-infectious GN.  A renal
biopsy was recommended.

Ms. [**Known lastname 59022**] had a renal biopsy on day 6 of her admission.
Unfortunately there were only 5 glomeruli in the specimen, all
globally sclerosed.  The interstitium was severely fibrosed, and
there was tubular atrophy, all consistent with advanced injury
that could not be specified.

Post-biopsy she developed flank pain, and was noted to have a
hematocrit drop from 31 to 25.  A CT of the abdomen demonstrated
a moderate-sized perinephric hematoma.  She again received FFP,
DDAVP, and 2 U PRBC.  Her hematocrit stabilized and she had no
further flank pain prior to discharge.

Her creatinine on discharge was still markedly above baseline at
6.1, and she was exhibiting mild signs of volume overload
(orthopnea, peripheral edema).  The renal team did not feel that
she met criteria for urgent hemodialysis, however, and she was
therefore seen by the dialysis team and set up with outpatient
follow up for probable need for dialysis in the near future.  Of
note, her PTH prior to discharge was 369 (up from 15 only a few
months prior).  She was also started on lasix at the
recommendation of the renal team, with the hopes of improving
her fluid  balance and controlling her hypertension (see below).

3) Pneumonia:  At the outside hospital she had been found to
have a LLL PNA and was therefore already on levo/flagyl on
transfer.  These were continued to complete a 7 day course.  She
remained afebrile throughout her course.  Her wbc was elevated
on admission, however this was felt to be related to the acute
liver injury, and trended down throughout the admission.  She
felt well throughout, and had no shortness of breath other than
orthopnea from her fluid overload.  Her oxygen saturation was
consistenly > 95%.

4) Hypertension:  She has a history of hypertension, and had
been taking toprol XL 25 mg daily.  In the MICU she had very
difficult to control hypertension, and was given metoprolol,
hydralazine, and amlodipine.  A labetalol drip was started very
briefly, for only a few hours.  On the floors, Mrs.[**Known lastname 59024**]
blood pressure was moderately well controlled on metoprolol 50
mg [**Hospital1 **], and amlodipine 10 mg daily.  She was given lasix 40 mg
PO once prior to discharge, and discharged on 80 mg PO daily,
per renal, plus toprol XL 100 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mg
daily.

5) Anemia:  The patient had a persistently low hematocrit during
the admission, however she also had an elevated LDH and
persistent nucleated RBCs, therefore hematology/oncology was
called. Review of peripheral smear was consistent with stress
hematopoesis due to acute liver failure and not autoimmune
hemolytic anemia.  They felt that her elevated LDH and bili, as
well as low haptoglobin, were all a result of her liver disease.
 She likely has an underlying anemia of chronic disease from her
renal failure.  Her hematocrit was stable between 30 and 32
prior to discharge.
