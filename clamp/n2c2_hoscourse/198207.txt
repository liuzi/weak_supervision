58 year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer who
presents with fever and tachycardia.

# Fever: Patient with fever to 102 and leukocytosis. This is
most likely an infectious in etiology. The differential includes
portacath infection given recent manipulation and timing of the
onset.  The port was last accessed on monday. Blood cultures
drawn peripherally but not from port. The patient also report
abdominal pain and has h/o abdominal abscess, but patient has
had pain at baseline. CXR today showed haziness in R lower base
concerning for early pna vs pulmonary edema.   UA negative
making pna and UTI unlikely.  Pt has elevated liver enzymes that
were normal on monday per patient. Could be elevated in setting
of sepsis. No change in bowel habit, no signs of menigitis, no
murmur on exam to suggest endocarditis. Tick borne disease
unlikely as pt does not have any pets and does not do outdoor
activities at all. No new drugs to suggest drug fever. Empiric
broad spectrum antibiotics for possible line
infection/intrabdominal process: linezolid, cefepime and flagyl
given possible allergy to vanc and levaquin? MRI of abdomen was
performed and found no intrabdominal abscess but subclinic
cholangisit. ID was consulted and thought it was ok to discharge
him on PO Augmetin for one week to follow up with primary
providers.
.
# Tacchycardia: Patient's HR was consistently 110-120s here.
Patient's ekg was c/w sinus tacchycardia. He is mildly fluid
responsive. This could be due to sepsis as above.  Pt high risk
for PE given onc hx, but no other signs of PE. Not anemic,
anxious or in pain. His BB was held.
.
# H/O SVT, currently sinus tacchycardia on ekg. Held metoprolol
given patient is febrile and may be peri-septic. Held BB at
discharge per patient request.
.
# ARF: likely prerenal in setting of possible sepsis
.
# Transaminitis: likely related to volume depletion and sepsis.
Since lfts were normal 2 days ago, liver abscess unlikely. Tbili
normal. Trended down.
.
# Anemia: crit at baseline to slightly higher. He is most likely
hemoconcentrated.
.
# Pancreatic cancer: defer to primary onc team
.
# Restless leg: cont mirapex
.
# HTN: hold lopressor
.
# GERD: cont prilosec
.
