# Angioedema: C/w angioedema.  Most commonly associated with
ACE-I.  Does have a history of similar episode; acquired C1
inhibitor deficiency possible - familial less likely given age
and absence of family hx.  Did just start iron supplement and
allergy to a component is possible, but time course not as
consistent and more likely kinin-mediated rather than mast cell
given absence of urticaria, prurutis.  No inhalant abuse; not
taking ASA or NSAIDS due to renal failure. Pharyngitis can cause
uvular swelling but no fever, exudates, or sore throat to
suggest acute infectious etiology.  Lisinopril was held on
admission and the patient was instructed not to resume this
medication.  Complement levels were checked.  His angioedema
resolved completely by the end of the day and he was discharged.
.
# HTN: He was restarted on home blood pressure medications
except for lisinopril.  Blood pressure was controlled and he was
discharged with instructions to f/u with his PCP.
.
# DM: He reports episodes of hypoglycemia at home in the 50s and
Lantus was recently lowered.  His Glyburide was stopped on
admission due to his end stage renal disease.  He will continue
to monitor his blood sugars regularly at home.
.
# ESRD: In work-up for PD and transplant. Sevelamer and
calcitriol continued.
