This is a 60 yo M with Hx of CVA admitted to [**Hospital1 **] 4 for suicidal
ideation (w/ no plan or attempts) was noted to have coffee
ground emesis twice this evening without prior Hx of GI bleed.
.
# Upper GIB: The patient has no history of gastric, hepatic, or
esopheal pathology. No predisposing medications. 2 peripheral
IV's in place. Pt typed and screened. Hemodynamically stable.
Initial tachycardia was concerning, but orthostatic signs were
negative. Stable Hct can be misleading as it was drawn soon
after episode and patient had not received volume in the
interim. The patient has an active type and scree. The patient's
coffee ground emesis resolved quickly with NG tube and lavage.
An IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] was started. IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] was changed to PO PPI [**Hospital1 **]
on [**7-23**].

team. Restarted trileptal.

# Hx of CVA: re-started ASA/ Plavix as per GI team's recs.
.
# urinary retention: when foley was pulled initially pt had
difficulty voiding. bladder scan at the time revealed 870cc
residual. straight cath was attempted but this met w/
resistance. Urology was consulted and they recommended
re-instating the foley catheter and starting pt on 0.4mg flomax
daily. the foley was left in place from [**7-25**] to [**7-28**] as per
urology's recs and it was removed on [**7-28**]. He passed his voiding
trial and was accepted for transfer to [**Hospital1 **] 4.
