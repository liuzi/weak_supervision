56 year old man with a history of chronic L>R painful lymphedema
was admitted to the hospital on [**2207-8-16**] with severe cellulitis
which we treated with aggressive ACE wrap and elevation, IV
antibiotics and IV diuresis. Despite antibiotics (vanco, cipro,
flagyl and zosyn) his WBC continues to rise with low grade
temps.   He also developed a new erythema over trunk so ID was
consulted on [**2207-8-20**]. His antibiotics were discontinued and he
was started on ceftaroline.  His cellulitis and rash slowly
improved though his unremitting pain in his LLE continued to
persist. After discussion with palliative care, chronic pain
services and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the decision was made to go forward
with a Left BKA to improve Mr. [**Known lastname 36515**] quality of life which
was performed (guillotine) on [**2207-8-23**].  At this point, his
antibiotic was then changed to Linezolid.  He returned to the OR
on [**2207-8-28**] for Re-amputation and closure of left below-knee
amputation.  Post operatively in the PACU, he required a brief
reintubation secondary to hypoxia. His CXR was consistent with
pulmonary edema.  He was monitored overnight in the CVICU then
transferred to the floor.

On the floor, he has made steady progress. He has remained
afebrile with baseline renal function and hemodynamically
stable.  He has worked with PT who recommended rehab.
In terms of his medications:
- We weaned his oxycontin from 40mg/day to 30mg/ day on [**2207-9-1**].
 He is due to have it decreased again on [**2207-9-3**]. Since the BKA
he has had minimal pain.
- He was restarted on coumadin on [**2207-9-1**] secondary to his
atrial fibrillation with [**Country **] score of 3.
- We did not restart  Moexipril 30 mg twice daily secondary to
ongoing aggressive diuresis and borderline renal function.
- He will continue on the linezolid until his postop check on
next week.
