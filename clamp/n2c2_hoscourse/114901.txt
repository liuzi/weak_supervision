Mr. [**Known lastname 88321**] is a 48 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for HCV cirrhosis and a recent admission for a traumatic fall
with multiple IPH requiring bolt placement, multiple orthopedic
fractures s/p surgeries, trach/PEG with hospital course
complicated by Serratia pneumonia treated with pip/tazo now
admitted for hypoxemia.

# Hypoxemia/leukocytosis: CTAP demonstrates a new right-sided
pleural effusion with RLL collapse and volume loss throughout
right side. Compressive atelectasis was considered, although
could not rule out HCAP. With regard to new pleural effusion,
LFTs were largely unchanged from prior, making hepatic
hydrothorax unlikely. This may be a parapneumonic effusion with
underlying pneumonia, or could also be from new heart failure.
Would also consider chylothorax given history of trauma. The
patient underwent thoracentesis on the first hospital day and
1.2 liters of exudative fluid were removed from the right
pleural space. Cultures from the fluid came back negative, and
the antibiotics were stopped. Trauma surgery was consulted who
felt that the pleural fluid might be secondary to trauma. They
recommended for repeat imaging in [**2-4**] days to see if the fluid
was reaccumulating. Also, they recommended for repeat imaging if
the patient develops any new respiratory symptoms.
Interestingly, the fluid from the thoracentesis had an
eosinophilic predominance (56% eosinophils). At the same time,
the patient was noted to have a peripheral blood eosinophilia.
This was all felt to be secondary to Depakote, which had been
recently started. The divalproex was therefore stopped.

Notably, after the thoracentesis, the patient's respiratory
status improved markedly and he was able to be weaned back to
the trach mask. With regard to work-up for other causes of
pleural effusion, a transthoracic echocardiogram did not show
any cardiac dysfunction, and infectious studies, as above, all
returned negative. Cytologic analysis showed no malignant cells.
Antibiotics were stopped after the first hospital day.

Due to the calficifications noted on CT scan, a tuberculin skin
test was placed to the right forearm on [**12-22**]. This should be
interpreted on [**12-24**] or [**12-25**]. The spot of the PPD placement is
marked with a bandaid.

# Mental status: His mental status remained at baseline, per
family members and rehab facility notes. He was agitated and
minimally interactive. He required prn doses of Haldol and
Ativan for agitation. With regard to the history of traumatic
brain injury, neurosurgery was consulted during this admission
and did not feel there was any need for intervention. Head CT
was deferred. He was continued on Keppra for seizure
prophylaxis. Divalproex, as above, was stopped due to peripheral
blood and pleural fluid eosinophilia.

# Anemia: Hematocrit was 35.8 on admission, baseline during last
admission 27-33 with macrocytosis. His hematocrit remained
stable.

# Orthopedics: Orthopedics was contact[**Name (NI) **] during this admission.
Follow-up plans are outlined in the discharge orders.

# HCV cirrhosis: LFTs were at baseline.

# Depression: Continue home psychotropic regimen.

# Ulcerative colitis: Not currently treated.

# Nutrition: pnt recieved TF's FEN: TF.
.
# PPx: recieved Heparin SQ.
.
# Access: Double lumen PICC in LAC; this was removed during the
admission as patient was no longer needing antibiotics or
continuous intravenous medicines.
.
# Code: Confirmed FULL [**Telephone/Fax (1) 88324**].
.
# Contact: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 88325**] (Sister).
# Dispo: ICU level of care, transferred back to rehab after the
thoracentesis and improvement in respiratory status.
