The patient was admitted for the question of small bowel
obstruction.  On CT scan she had an area of twisted bowel along
with her large parastomal hernia.  Her ostomy output had no
stool or gas in it.  She was taken to the OR to resolve these
issues.  In the OR she had a large amount of barium in the small
intestine which was moved into the cecum.  She had a
hyperkalemia directly following surgery which resolved with an
insulin drip.  She was admitted to the ICU for this purpose.
Her blood sugars were difficult to control post-operatively and
she was maintained on the insulin drip for the first 3 days
post-operatively.  It was also difficult to ween her from her O2
needs post-op (this was most likely due to her very long smoking
history).  Eventually she was restarted on her home metformin
and was able to come off of oxygen therapy.  On day 3
post-operatively gas and stool appeared at her ostomy following
a bowel regimen of colace and mineral oil.  She was discharged
home to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] in clinic.  She was
tolerating PO intake at discharge and was in good condition.
