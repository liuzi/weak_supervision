Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old man with CAD, CHF, who was admitted
with hypoxia and AMS. Respiratory failure worsened during his
hospital course despite treatments. He was made CMO and
terminally extubated on [**2104-8-27**]. The patient died at 7:03pm.
.
.
# HYPOXIA/DYSPNEA: The patient was transfered from OSH with
hypoxia and dyspnea. We began treatment of LUL pneumonia
empirically with levofloxacin (for CAP coverage), vancomycin
(HAP coverage), and cefepime (for pseudomonal coverage). On the
second day of hospitalization, levofloxacin was stopped and he
was continued on vanc/cef for total of a 14 day course.  Due to
the fact that his pneumonia was not improving since his original
diagnosis [**2104-7-15**], pulmonology was consulted. Urine legionella
was negative, LDH was elevated at 392.  A CT of the Chest on
[**8-9**] showed marked worsening of nonspecific multifocal
ground-glass opacities and consolidations predominantly
involving the left upper, right upper, left lower and portions
of the right lower lobes of infectious v. inflammatory v.
hemorrhagic etiology.  Bronchoscopy on [**8-14**] was grossly normal,
no signs of hemorrhage (only abnormality small nonobstructing
membrane extending about one-third of the way into the airway
lumen in the posterior segment of the left upper lobe).  BAL
showed hemosiderin-laden macrophages and multinucleated
histiocytes and was negative for malignant cells, PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 18092**], and CMV, and was significant only for 1+ PMNs and
10-100K yeast, most likely colonizer).  Blood cultures were
negative x 5, HIV was negative, aspergillus negative, hepatitis
serologies were negative.  Infectious w/u was significant only
for a positive serum beta glucan (163), and at time of transfer
to the MICU cryptococcus and quantiferon gold were pending.
Inflammatory w/u negative for anti-GBM negative, complement
normal, ANCA negative, ESR elevated at 60.   He completed a 14
day course of vanc/cef without improvement in pulmonary status.
Repeat chest CT on [**8-17**] showed interval progression of
multifocal consolidations, likely representing infections,
although inflammatory condition is a possibility as well as new
small bilateral pleural effusions. He was again started on 40 mg
IV lasix daily with appropriate diuresis.  Infectious disease
was consulted on [**8-21**] and recommended VATS for definitive
diagnosis as it was not felt that the underlying pulmonary
process represented an infectious etiology, however he was not
deemed to be a surgical candidate due to his many comorbidities.
 Per chest CT, there was concern that the ground glass opacities
on repeat chest CT may represent usual interstitial pneumonitis,
the treatment of which would be steroids.  On [**8-21**] he was
started on empiric IV solumedrol 80 mg TID which was tapered to
80 mg IV BID on [**8-23**].  Repeat CXR on [**8-24**] showed no significant
change from prior and plans were for steroid taper.

Throughout hospital stay, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was on supplementary O2 as
needed, incentive spirometry, and albuterol/ipratropium nebs. O2
was weaned and sats were consistently in the low 90s on room air
and in the mid-high 90s on 2L O2 NC.
.
# DELIRIUM: Patient came in with delirium, which he did not have
at baseline (was travelling in [**Country 18084**], hiking with family in
[**Month (only) 216**]). The likely etiology of his delirium was considered his
ongoing infection +/- hospitalizations. UA was performed and was
negative, a UCx showed no growth, which ruled out UTI as the
cause of delirium. A CT head at last admission was negative for
any intracranial process and repeat head CT on [**8-19**], obtained
after an unwitnessed fall from bed with no signs of trauma again
showed no acute intracranial process, again showed small vessel
ischemic disease, unchanged old lacunar infarcts in the
bilateral basal ganglia and extreme capsule, and prominent
ventricles and sulci. On admission he was initially given
Olanzapine 5mg po q6h PRN agitation and haldol.  Geriatrics
follwoed the patient for management of his persistent delerium
and sundowning and per their recommendations olanzapine was
swithced to seroquel and uptitrated to 12.5 QAM and 37.5 QHS
with PRN seroquel and haldol.  Delerium was also managed with
soft restraints and cage bed in order to keep Mr. [**Known lastname **] from
injuring staff and pulling out his lines.

Neurology was consulted on admission and initially felt his
confusion was due to his underlying pulmonary process.  However,
when he failed to improve despite antibiotics and no source of
infection was identified, they were reconsulted on [**8-21**] and
recommended LP, MRI w/ and w/o contrast, and EEG due to concern
for limibic encephalitis vs. paraneoplastic process vs. temporal
lobe epilepsy.  Patient is not a candidate for MRI due to his
Zenith AAA stent graft.  At the time of transfer LP had so far
shown normal glucose, protein, and WBC, no organisms on Gram
stain, no growth on preliminary bacterial, fungal, and acid fast
cultures, negative cryptococcal antigen.  CSF HSV and VDRL
pending at time of transfer.  Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibodies were negative.
Serum RPR and [**Location (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] antibody panel, and 1,25 vitamin D
were pending.  Patient was also undergoing EEG monitoring at the
time of transfer.
.
# CHF: The patient has a history of CHF (EF 40-45% per TTE done
in [**4-/2104**]) and his CXR has presence of some mild pulmonary
edema.  He was initially continued on his home Lasix 40 mg po qd
for CHF management, and medical management was continued with
continued Carvedilol and Losartan.  His lasix was discontinued
for several days due to worsening delerium and no IV access and
NPO status.  Repeat chest CT on It was restarted intermittently
at 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].  On [**8-19**] a loud MR murmur was noted on physical
exam and repeat TTE was poor quality and showed EF of 30-35%,
question of worsening MR, and antero/anterolateral hypokinesis.

.
# CAD with h/o MI: Isosorbide Mononitrate ER 30mg daily and ASA
were held the day after admission for systolic blood pressures
in the low 100s, some bloody sputum and supratherapeutic INR
(3.8 on admission).  He was a poor historian and intermittently
[**Month/Day (1) 12861**] substernal chest pain.  EKGs demonstrated TWI in the
anterior, anterolateral, and inferolateral leads.  Troponins
were elevated at 0.07 to 0.1 with normal CK-MB and cardiology
was consulted and felt this was most likely demand ischemia so
he continued on medical management, Asa was restarted, and he
was placed on carvedilol and [**Last Name (un) **] ([**Last Name (un) **] until [**8-18**] when his Cr
bumped.)  On the morning of transfer, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12861**] [**4-24**]
substernal chest pressure, as he had intermittently reported
throughout hospitalization and cardiac enzymes were again
checked and showed troponin 0.02 (down from prior) and ECG
showed no significant change from baseline.
.
# AFIB: Patient was rate controlled on admission and remained
irregularly irregular throughout his hospital course. Patient
had an elevated INR (3.8) on admission with no evidence of acute
bleed, so coumadin was held but rate control was continued with
carvedilol.  His carvedilol dose was stopped and restarted after
he developed an episode of A.fib with RVR on [**8-13**].  INR trended
down and coumadin was again started on [**8-14**] at a low dose of 2
mg daily.  It was deemed to be safely stopped on [**8-16**] in
preparation for G-J tube placement in IR, as the patient had no
reported history of stroke, and patient was given one dose of 1
mg of IV vitamin K on [**9-1**] and [**8-22**] (3 mg total).
Warfarin has been held since [**8-18**].
.
# HTN: Pt has a history of HTN. We continued home Losartan 100
mg Tablet until [**8-18**] when Cr bumped.
.
# FEN: During previous hospitalizations, patient was evaluated
by speech and swallow who thought he might be having silent
aspiration and recommended soft diet and nectar thick fluids
with monitoring when taking in by mouth food and medications. We
continued soft diet and nectar thick fluid with aspiration
precautions.  Video swallow on [**8-11**] showed aspiration of all
consistencies and he was made NPO.  Repeat video swallow on [**8-15**]
again showed florid aspiration.  On [**8-21**] he was allowed to take
sips and eat a dysphagia diet because he had been NPO for 10
days, had poor IV access, and had not tolerated multiple
attempts at dobhoff placement on the floor and G-J placement in
the IR suite.  It was also felt that his underlying lung process
was due to a significantly more severe process than aspiration
alone.  He was also started on PPN on the evening of [**8-22**] and
received intermittent PPN.  On the evening of transfer he was
permitted to receive supervised milkshake spoon-feeding
administered at bedside by his daughter.

# Hypernatremia:
On [**8-21**] the patient developed hypernatremia to the 140s with a
max of 153 on [**8-22**] in the setting of IV lasix followed by no IV
access.  He was spoon fed water and intermittently received up
D5W with improvement in his Na to 144 on the day of transfer
([**8-24**]).

# ARF:
On [**8-18**] the patient developed a Cr bump to 1.4 in the setting of
lasix administration.  A true vanc trough the following morning
was elevated at 42.  Vancomycin was d/c'd and the patient was
hydrated with D51/2NS.  His creatinine remained elevated, FeNa
was <0.1% on [**8-24**], and his [**Last Name (un) **] and lasix continued to be held
until the patient triggered on the evening of [**8-24**], prompting
him to receive 40 mg of IV lasix prior to transfer to the MICU.

# Rash:
On admission the patient was noted to have a mild petechial rash
and on [**8-12**] the patient the rash was notably brightly
erythematous, purpuric, confluent, and morbiliform rash and
extended to all four extremities and his back.  He has a
concurrent eosinophilia (14.3%).  Biopsy was consistent with
leukocytoclastic vaculitis.  Ddx included vasculitis vs. drug
reaction.  He had started cefepime 3-4 days prior to the rash.
He was continued on cefepime and the rash resolved as did the
eosinophilia (5.5% when last checked on [**8-17**]).

# Transaminitis:
Patient had elevated LFTs at admission, statin was held.  LFTs
trended down, statin was restarted.  LFTs inadvertently checked
[**8-23**], mildly elevated again, statin held.
