Assessment and Plan:
80F with past medical of history of gastric ulcer, right
peroneal DVT in [**2111**] on indefinite anti-coagulation with
warfarin which has been held since [**2112-6-14**] in setting of
multiple admission to OSH for melanotic stools, PVD s/p multiple
lower extremity revascularization, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
presenting with upper GIB confirmed on EGD during this admission


# Upper GI bleed, gastric ulcers
Patient presented reporting signs and symptoms of upper GIB with
melanotic stool and hematemsis and was supported by significant
BUN/Cr dissociation. The patient underwent EGD which showed
multiple ulcers in the stomach with evidence of recent bleed.
She was transfused 3 U pRBCs during the admission- two in the ED
and one in the MICU, and put on IV PPI and sucralfate.  Patient
was hemodynamically stable throughout with and hematocrits held
around 30.

#VAP/Hypoxia
She developed a fever in the MICU,  and given that it was 24 hrs
after intubtation with question of an infiltrate on CXR, she was
started on cefepime and vancomycin which she received for 24
hrs.  These meds were d/ced on the floor as repeat CXR did not
show good evidence of pneumonia and she did not look clinically
infected. She was treated empirically with Vancomycin 75 mg q 12
and Cefepime 1 g q 12 hr.  A repeat CXR PA and Lateral was
obtained which was not impressive for an infiltrate- the patient
remained asymptomatic and afebrile so the abx were discontinued
at 24 hrs.  However, on exam the patient was noted to have
crackles about halfway up on both lung fields.  She was given a
one time IV dose of lasix and restarted on her home regimen.
Her oxygen requirements were optimized by the time of discharge
and she was on her home lasix regimen.

#Drug-induced Pancytopenia
Patient has had thrombocytopenia on past labs of uncertain
etiology.  She was noted to have downtrending WBCs to 1.6 by [**10-15**]
and was technically still anemic.  A smear noted some occasional
schistocytes but hemolysis labs were negative.  Hematology was
consulted and thought the vancomycin or cefepime was causing
marrow toxicity.  She was monitored for the next few days until
her counts began to increase.  They went up to WBC 2.6 21%
neutrophils (ANC still below 1000).  Per heme recs she was given
1 dose of neupogen.  Her CBC then increased to WBC 7.1 with
almost 70% neutrophils.  She was discharged with close follow up
with her hematologist.Her CBC was closely monitored during her
hospital stay.

# Hypertension
The patient's home blood pressure medications were held when
admitted to the ICU for concern of GIB.  She actually became
hypertensive during this time.  Upon arrival to the floor her
home BP meds were restarted as below.  She remained stable,
although with an episode of overnight hypertension 2 days prior
to discharge.
- diovan 320 mg PO qD
- labetalol 100 mg PO TID
- nidefipine ER 60 mg PO qD

#PVD: Patient was originally scheduled to have a revision of a
previous vascular surgery during the time frame of her
admission.  This was obviously postponed, but the issue of her
anticoagulation remained.  She had a prior DVT which she takes
warfarin for but this has been held since [**Month (only) 116**] due to recurrent
GI bleeds.  The vascular surgery team expressed they would like
her anticoagulated for her PVD.  After consulting with both GI
and Vascular it was decided that she could go out on plavix, and
hold aspirin given her risk of rethrombosis in her vascular
stents combined with the stability of the bleed.


# Acute renal insufficiency
Patient has baseline Cr ~ 0.7 with admission Cr 1, which came
down to 0.9- no issues since admission

CHRONIC ISSUES

# Chronic back pain
- continued tramadol prn

# Hyperlipidemia
- continued statin, ezetimibe

# History of DVT
- We held warfarin as above

Transitional Issues
-She will follow up with hematology in 3 days for repeat cbc.
-Patient has blood cultures and urine cultures that need follow
up
-She should also be optimized on home BP meds for better
hypertension control
