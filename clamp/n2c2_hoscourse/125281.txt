  On [**4-17**], a Roux tube cholangiogram was
done. This revealed a large contrast collection in the region
of the left hepatic lobe consistent with a large bile leak.
There was associated dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts
with numerous filling defects consistent with sloughed mucosa
and debris. These findings were concerning for biliary
ischemia.

On [**4-18**], he went to CT for successful aspiration and a
drainage catheter placement in the large hepatic fluid
collection. He also underwent a TTE which was negative for
vegetations on the heart valves. Ejection fraction was
approximately 55%. The fluid from the above tap of abdominal
fluid grew 3 organisms: Enterococcus gallinarum, Strep
viridans heavy growth, and enterococcus. The enterococcus was
pansensitive and indeterminate for vancomycin. The
enterococcus 2nd species was resistant to ampicillin,
levofloxacin, penicillin, and tetracycline.

He remained on daptomycin. He continued on his Rapamune
throughout this hospital course with dose adjustments based
on level. His appetite was poor. He received calorie counts.
He was taking in anywhere from 845 kilocalories per day to
1,100 kilocalories per day. His liver function tests on
admission demonstrated an AST of 126, ALT of 79, alkaline
phosphatase of 134 with a total bilirubin of 0.4. These
remained relatively stable. There was slight increase in the
alkaline phosphatase noted.

He went for repositioning of the CT-guided drain on [**4-23**].
On [**4-26**], he spiked a temperature up to 101 again while on
the daptomycin. Repeat blood cultures were drawn daily on
[**4-20**] through [**4-24**]. These were all negative.

On [**4-27**], he underwent another CT-guided drainage. His
pigtail catheter was in place. There was interval decrease in
the size of the intrahepatic abscess with persistent ascites.
He continued to drain small amounts of fluid from this
pigtail catheter.

Infectious disease was consulted and followed the patient
closely throughout this hospital course making
recommendations with respect to antibiotic coverage. A CMV
viral load was sent off on [**2122-4-15**]. This was
subsequently found to be negative. Bile was sent from the PTC
drain. This demonstrated E. coli and Enterococcus gallinarum.
The E. coli was resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin,
levofloxacin, and Bactrim. Otherwise, pansensitive. The
enterococcus was pansensitive.

He was started on levofloxacin on hospital day 16, and he
remained on levofloxacin for a total of 7 days. He continued
to complain of upper abdominal discomfort for several days.
White blood cell count improved from admission. White count
of 2.1; it rose to 9.9 on hospital day 13. Given poor
appetite and low calorie counts, he was started on total
parenteral nutrition via PICC line. A right arm PICC line was
placed on [**2122-4-21**]. [**Last Name (un) **] followed the patient for
hyperglycemia helping to titrate his insulin. Nutrition also
followed this patient throughout this hospital course making
recommendations.

On [**4-30**], hospital day 16, he underwent successful
ultrasound-guided therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis.
Three-point 2 liters of dark-yellow fluid was withdrawn. This
fluid demonstrated no growth and 4+ polymorphonuclear
leukocytes.

Around hospital day 13, he started to complain of abdominal
distention and tenderness in the upper abdominal area. He had
a reducible hernia. He did experience some nausea and had
some emesis. He was medicated with Anzemet. He continued to
complain of persistent burning upper abdominal pain that
waxed and waned. The patient refused an upper endoscopy to
evaluate nausea. It was noted that on his paracentesis, he
had elevated white blood cells consistent with peritonitis
for which he remained on Levaquin for approximately 1 week. A
NG tube was placed on hospital day 18 for nausea and
vomiting.

NG tube put out approximately 4 liters per day consistent
with outlet obstruction. Hepatology followed the patient
closely throughout this hospital course. It is felt the
patient had an ileus related to opioids for abdominal pain
for which he was receiving p.r.n. Dilaudid with good effect.
He was taken to the OR on [**2122-5-3**] for complete small
bowel obstruction secondary to an internal hernia. He
underwent a reduction of internal hernia, closure of
mesocolon defect, Tru-Cut biopsy of the liver, and feeding
jejunostomy. Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] did the surgery, assisted
by resident, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 955**] under general anesthesia.
Patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see operative
report. He did receive 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Blood loss was minimal.

His abdominal pain was much better postsurgery. He remained
on IV daptomycin and Levaquin. He spiked a temperature on
[**5-11**] to 104, which he had a chest x-ray that demonstrated
no pneumonia with improving right apical hydropneumothorax.
He underwent an abdominal CT with successful replacement and
drainage of the left hepatic lobe collection with a small 3.2
cm residual collection along its anteromedial aspect. Of
note, a new hypodense collection in the lateral subcapsular
segment 5 yielded only a small amount of [**11-17**] cc of purulent
material. A small hemoperitoneum was noted postaspiration.

He was transferred to the SICU for further management. Blood
cultures demonstrated E. coli. Bile also grew E. coli
resistant to ampicillin, levofloxacin, Cipro, and Bactrim.
Enterococcus was indeterminate to vancomycin, otherwise
pansensitive. A urine culture was negative. He remained on
daptomycin. In addition to the temperature spike of 104, his
white blood cell count increased to 20.4. He also complained
of some lightheadedness and dizziness. He was transferred to
the surgical intensive care unit for IV resuscitation and
monitoring.

He was started on vasopressin. He remained on Levaquin,
Flagyl, ceftazidime, and daptomycin as well as linezolid.
Repeat abdominal CT was done on [**5-12**] with successful
replacement and drainage of the left hepatic lobe collection
as previously stated. He underwent a renal ultrasound at that
time. This demonstrated patent main renal arteries
bilaterally. Renal artery stenosis could not be excluded on
this technically limited exam. This was done for elevated
creatinine of 1.4. Creatinine trended back down with IV
hydration.

He experienced postop ileus as well. He had been started on
J. tube feedings, and his TPN had been weaned off. While in
the surgical intensive care unit, he was intubated. He was
started on meropenem. The ceftazidime was discontinued. The
left liver abscess collection had gram-positive cocci. The
right abscess had also gram-positive cocci. Blood cultures
were positive for E. coli and gram-negative rods.

Gradually he improved. He was extubated on [**5-16**]. His white
blood cell count trended down. A repeat abdominal CT was done
on [**5-15**]. This demonstrated improving 5-cm segment 4 liver
abscess with pigtail catheter. Two other dominant fluid
collections were unchanged. Ascites was worse. There was
resolution of the small bowel obstruction.

On [**5-15**], he was relisted for liver transplant with
resolution of small bowel obstruction. His J. tube feeding
was resumed. He tolerated this without event. He continued to
do well. He received a total of 6 days of meropenem.

He was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit on
[**5-19**]. He did experience some diarrhea for which stools were
sent for C. difficile. These were subsequently negative. He
remained on p.o. fluconazole for cryptococcal treatment. He
had a history of cryptococcal pneumonia and was to remain on
fluconazole for 1 year. He received empiric Flagyl for
diarrhea.

On [**5-19**], he underwent an abdominal CT with contrast. This
demonstrated slight increase in size of the previously seen
segment 4 hepatic abscess/bile collection. Previously placed
pigtail catheter appeared to have been removed. There was
slight increase also in segment 2 abscess with a new drainage
catheter in place. The 3rd collection in the right lobe was
unchanged. There was abundant ascites tracking into the
pelvis and scrotum via the inguinal canals. This was
unchanged. There were also bilateral small pleural effusions
with associated atelectasis.

A repeat abdominal CT was done on [**5-21**]. A right-sided liver
pigtail drain was inserted as well as the left side liver
pigtail drain was placed. Paracentesis was done, and the
drain was inserted. Three liters of straw-color fluid was
sent off for culture and cell count. This demonstrated 2+
polymorphonuclear leukocytes and enterococcus resistant to
ampicillin, penicillin, and vancomycin, but sensitive to
linezolid. No anaerobes were isolated.

On [**2122-5-22**], the ascites fluid was increased. He still
had a pigtail drain in place. Two liters of fluid were
drained off utilizing low wall suction, then 5 additional
liters were removed via the standard paracentesis tube with
suction bottle. Patient tolerated this without incident, and
the pigtail catheter was removed. This ascites fluid
demonstrated Enterococcus faecium resistant to vancomycin and
sensitive to linezolid. He continued on daptomycin. He was
started on caspofungin IV for yeast that was detected in the
abscess drainage drawn on [**5-21**].

He received 2 units of blood on [**5-23**] for a hematocrit of
26. He was started on Epogen. He received another unit of
blood on [**5-24**] for hematocrit of 29.5. His temperature
spiked to 101 again on [**5-24**]. PICC was removed. No growth
was demonstrated. Urine culture was negative. Blood cultures
were sent daily for surveillance. These were all negative.
His white blood cell count started to trend down into the 2.3
range.

Repeat abdominal CT was done on [**5-24**] for this temperature
spike of 101. No evidence of contrast extravasation or large
hematoma within the abdomen or pelvis was noted to explain
the patient's drop in hematocrit from 34.9 down to 26.2.
There was persistent pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectasis. He had a stable appearing hepatic abscesses and
bile collections within segments 4 and 2 of the liver. There
was slight decrease in the size of the right lobe collection
with a new drainage catheter in place. There was also slight
interval decrease in abundant ascites tracking into the
pelvis and scrotum.

He was given IV Lasix for edema. This was stopped when his
blood pressure dropped down to 90/70. He had been on IV
Lopressor as well as p.o. Lopressor for some tachycardia;
though, the Lopressor was stopped. He received some IV
hydration.

A podiatry consult was obtained for long toenails. These were
debrided. An ophthalmology consult was also obtained for
patient's complaint of progressive decrease vision in both
eyes. Findings demonstrated left greater than right
subcapsular cataracts, presbyopia, and refractive error.
[**Location (un) **] glasses were suggested, and cataract evaluation as an
outpatient.

Given drop in white blood cell count, meropenem was stopped.
He had received a total of 14 days of this. Caspofungin was
also stopped after a total of 6 days, and ceftriaxone 1 gram
was started daily as well as AmBisome 675 mg daily. His white
blood cell count still continued to stay in the 2.1-2.8
range. His hematocrit trended downward to 23.7. Epogen was
increased. His creatinine remains stable. His LFTs were
stable. Rapamune was continued. His levels trended downward
to 3.8. He was tolerating his tube feeding. Foley catheter
remained in place given large scrotal edema. Physical therapy
worked with him and recommended rehab.

He was started on AmBisome on [**5-27**] for concern for mold in
the abscess that could be consistent with Zygomycetes. He
continued to have low grade temperatures of 100.9. He
remained on ceftriaxone for Strep viridans replacing the
meropenem. A repeat CT was done on [**5-28**]. Several fluid
collections were again noted within the left and right lobes
of the liver which were unchanged in size. There were 3
external percutaneous drainage catheters in place and 1
internal/external biliary catheter was unchanged in position.
Bilateral pleural effusions were noted and large amount of
ascites was noted.

Wound care consult was obtained for sacral decubitus. He has
a full-thickness ulcer coccyx site unable to stage due to
yellow fibrinous wound bed. The ulcer is approximately 2 x 1
cm. Wound bed is 100% yellow and fibrinous. Wound edges were
defined. There was minimal drainage from the site. No
cellulitis was noted. Wound gel, DuoDerm gel was applied to
the ulcer. He remained on a ________low air loss pressure
release mattress.

In summary, the patient had a prolonged hospital course and
became debilitated. He was relisted for a liver transplant
pending clearance of multiple liver abscesses, infections.
His p.o. intake was poor. He remained on cycled J. tube
feedings at night. Foley remained in place for large amount
of scrotal edema. His right JP abscess drain continued to
drain murky discharge with bilious drainage from his liver
abscesses. His PTC catheter remained capped. He was assisted
out of bed to the chair by PT.

Plan is to send him to rehab on daptomycin, caspofungin, and
ceftriaxone. He will follow up with infectious disease.
