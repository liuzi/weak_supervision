The patient was admitted to the transplant surgery service.  She
underwent liver ultrasound and biopsy.  See results section.
She also had a CTA of her liver which confirmed PV stenosis at
the anastamosis.  Due to a concern for stenosis of her bile duct
anastamosis as well from the ultrasound images she underwent
ERCP and a stent was placed.  Blood cultures from [**10-10**] showed
ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE (ESBL, sensitive to meropenem).  She had a
replacement of her dobhoff (postpyloric) done the following day
as well as a PICC line placed given a need for IV antibiotics
for her bacteremia.

Her TF were resumed post-dobhoff and she was tolerating a
regular diet, ambulating independently, and tolerating her
immunosuppression medications.  Her LFTs improved upon admission
and continued improvement and stabilization through her hospital
stay.  She was discharged to home on [**10-13**] with plans to return to
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10 for admission Tuesday morning 6am for a planned venogram
for her PV stenosis.  She was discharged on Tacrolimus 1mg [**Hospital1 **].
A tacrolimus blood level will be checked upon admission on
Tuesday.  Her steroid taper was at 15mg on discharge (1st day of
15).
