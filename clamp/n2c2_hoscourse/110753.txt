# Pericardial effusion: On admission the patient was taken to
cath lab for pericardiocentesis. During the procedure
pericardial fluid was failed to be obtained. Hemodynamics
inconsistent with tamponade physiology. The patient was admitted
to the CCU for continued monitoring. Repeat TTE [**12-7**] demonstrated
new LA and RV invagination. CT surgery was consulted and the
patient was taken for pericardial window. She tolerated the
procedure well with no complications. Drain and chest tube
placed during procedure. Removed on [**12-10**] after repeat TTE on [**12-10**]
demonstrated a normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and normal systolic function and a resolution of
pericardial fluid. Her pericardial fluid was of unclear
etiology. Rheumatology was consulted and her sulfasalazine was
discontinued for concern of drug induced lupus given effusion
and decreasing WBC. WBC did stabalize after stopping medication.
Also concern for collagen vascular disease. Panel of autoimmune
antibodies pending at time of discharge. Cytology and
pericardial biopsy also pending at time of discharge. [**Doctor First Name **] to
evaluate for TB as cause pending. The patient did report recent
URI symptoms, can consider pericarditis as cause of effusion.
EBV, CMV pending. HIV negative. She also reports a family
history of breast CA - recent mamogram WNL. The patient was
discharged home in good condition to follow up with her PCP and
rheumatology for further management.

# Hypotension - Pt BP range 80s-110 systolic. The patient does
have low BP at baseline. Reported recent poor po intake and
history of eating disorder. She received intermittent fluid
bolus, likely due to increased insensible losses. She also has a
history of increased urine output with lithium induced CRI.
.
# Psych: continued on home medications Abilify, Quetiapine
.
# Question of Psoriatic arthiritis: continued prednisone per
Rheumatology recommendation. Sulfasalazine DC'd due to concern
for drug induced lupus
.
# Vaginal Bleeding - During her hospitalization the patient
reported scant vaginal bleeding. She has been post-menopausal
for many years. She was advised to undergo further workup for
this bleeding as outpatient. Given her past history of sexual
abuse she has reported refusing previous pelvic examination.

# Fibromyalgia: continued tizanidine and Ultram

# CKD: creatinine at baseline.

The patient is scheduled to follow up with Cardiology, CT
surgery, Rheumatology and her PCP for further management. Also
to follow up on outstanding pericardial fluid cytology and
biopsy, as well as pending Autoimmune workup.
