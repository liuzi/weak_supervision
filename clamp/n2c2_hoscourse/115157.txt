66 yo m with DM, h/o CAD s/p CABG with PCI in '[**99**], severe PVD,
CKD, and s/p Vfib arrest who presents with 1 day of vague
symptoms found to have hypotension, [**Last Name (un) **] and elevated CE.

# Shock/Hypotension: On arrival to the ED, patient's exam was
most consistent with cardiogenic shock, with a prior known EF
25-30%. He had no evidence of sepsis or hypovolemia on exam. His
hypotension was likely triggered by new administration of
minoxidil causing hypotension and stress leading to stress and
demand ischemia.  Home BP medications were held, and he was
started on levophed with a goal MAP of 55-60.  On admission to
the MICU, an a-line was placed for monitoring of his blood
pressures. Overnight in the MICU he required increasing doses of
levophed to maintain blood pressure. His CE were trended,
showing elevation of troponin and mild elevation in CK in
setting of acute kidney injury and demand ischemia.  Repeat Echo
showed stable EF of 25-30%, RV free wall hypokinesis and apical
akinesis. The patient was transferred to the CCU for further
management of cardiogenic shock.  Levophed was transitioned to
dopamine and patient was started on lasix gtt for diuresis with
good result.  Dopamine was weaned off on [**2204-4-11**].  Throughout
hospitalization, patient was maintained on therapeutic INR with
coumadin or with therapeutic PTT with heparin gtt given history
of recently diagnosed LV thrombus.  In setting of renal failure,
patient was started on carvedilol on [**2204-4-11**] and was not
restarted on atenolol. As an outpatient, the patient should be
restarted on [**Last Name (un) **] and spironolactone as tolerated by BP and
recovery of kidney function.

Of note, noninvasive blood pressures were difficult to monitor
on patient secondary to severe PVD.  Carotid dopplers showed
possible subclavian steal on right, so BP should be monitored on
left.

# Coronaries: Upon admission serial EKG showed nonspecific ST
changes in the lateral leads, that were initially concerning for
ACS.  Cardiac enzymes were trended, showing elevation of
troponin to 0.95 with only mild CK elevation in the setting of
worsened renal failure (see below) and cardiogenic shock.
Patient continued on ASA, plavix and atorvostatin through
duration of hospitalization.  Atenolol was held secondary to
renal failure and hypotension, and was later transitioned to
carvedilol once cardiogenic shock had resolved. Carvedilol dose
uptitrated to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] by time of discharge but other
anti-hypertensives were held since BP had been so low at
presentation and had not yet rebounded to previously elevated
levels.

# Acute Kidney Injury on chronic kidney disease: Patient
admitted with oliguric renal failure with Cr elevated to 5.0
from baseline of 2.6.  Likely etiology secondary to ATN in the
setting of his ongoing hypotension and poor forward flow.  Renal
was consulted for help with management given his possible need
for catheterization and severe renal dysfunction.  Kidney
function improved with initiation of dopamine and lasix gtt.
Home [**Last Name (un) **] and atenolol were held given worsened renal function.
Renal function was trended daily with creatinine peaking at 6.5.
 On discharge had improved to 3.8 and was trending in the right
direction but will be rechecked on Monday at Dr.[**Name (NI) 5452**] office.

# Altered mental status/reported neurologic changes: Presented
with vague neurologic complaints of confusion, dysarthria, and
facial droop which had resolved by presentation to the ED.
Initially the patient was noted to have some waxing - [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status thought to be secondary to toxic metabolic
encephalopathy from azotemia and cerbral hypoperfusion from
hypotension.  Neurologic exam was nonfocal and mental status
improved through hospital course.  Neurology was consulted and
felt that initial presentation was consistent with a TIA.  For
secondary prevention,  risk factor management was optimized and
patient constinued on strict control of hypercholesterolemia,
hypertension, and on antiplatelet agents. HA1C was found to be
10.6. Patient contined on coumadin to prevent embolic stroke
from known LV thrombus although this was held for a couple days
during hospitalization while there was concern that proceedure
might be needed as below.

# Known LV thrombus: Pt with history of LV thrombus documented
on prior TTE. Had been on warfarin as an outpatient but this was
held for a couple days as inpatient as concern that patient
would need additional invasive proceedures. Placed on heparin
gtt to cover while INR subtherapeutic. Warfarin was restarted 2
days prior to D/c and INR climbing but only up to 1.8 on day of
D/c so pt administered one sub-cutaneous dose of 80mg enoxaparin
on day of discharge and given script for one additional dose of
80mg enoxaparin the next day. Pharmacy was contact[**Name (NI) **] to confirm
that dosing should be 80mg daily for therapeutic
anti-coagulation in setting of improving renal failure.

# Transaminitis: New this admission, likely secondary to poor
forward flow given his presentation of hypotension.  Trended
through hospital course and noted to be downtrending.

# Diabetes: Type II on insulin, on 75/25 [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 387**]
recommendations.  Home regimen was held upon admission given
poor PO intake and patient transitioned to glargine + ISS.
Insulin regimen was adjusted to maintain blood sugars in
100-200. Ultimately put on NPH (70/30) regimen of 15 units in AM
and 15 units in PM with ISS to cover. Discharged on this
regimen.

# Incidental CT findings - noted incidentally on CT A/p. Large
appendix (12 mm diameter) but no secondary signs of
appendicitis, enlarged pretracheal lymph node and hyperdense
right renal mass that may represent a hemorrhagic cyst requires
outpatient surgical follow-up.
