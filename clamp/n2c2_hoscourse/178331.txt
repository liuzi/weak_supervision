76 year-old female with a complicated PMHX that includes CAD s/p
LCx stenting in [**2122**], DM type 2, s/p PPM placement for
bradycardia, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, with severe PVD
s/p mutliple interventions, now s/p RLE angiography and right
anterior tibial artery PTCA with post-procedure hypotension and
RP bleed. Transferred to the CCU for further care.

1) Retroperitoneal bleed: Her hypotension was felt secondary to
her retroperitoneal bleed and likely vagal response at the time
of the sheath pull. As mentioned in the HPI, she was transfused
2 units of PRBCs in the cath lab, and was transfused an
additional unit in the CCU. She was also given IVF. She remained
hemodynamically stable throughout her stay in the CCU, without
need for pressors, and her HCT also remained stable following
the 3 units of PRBCs. Coumadin was held in the setting of her RP
bleed, to be restarted as an outpatient. Aspirin was resumed on
[**2125-1-25**] and well tolerated. Her hematocrit was 31.1 at
discharge.

2) s/p PTCA to right [**Doctor First Name **]: She was continued on aspirin while in
hospital. Pedal pulses were present via Doppler. She will
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in the week following discharge.

3) CAD: No acute issues in hospital. She was continued on
Lipitor. Aspirin, Atenolol, Diovan, and Lisinopril were
gradually resumed in hospital following the procedure.

4) Mental status change: On arrival to the CCU, Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] was
noted to be confused, belligerent. Her acute mental status
change was felt most likely medication-related s/p
administration of Fentanyl in the cath lab, sedatives. No gross
electrolyte abnormalities, ABG unremarkable. She responded to
Haldol for acute agitation/confusion. She was alert and oriented
the following morning without recurrence of confusion.

5) Diabetes mellitus type 2: She was kept on a regular insulin
sliding scale in hospital. Her diabetes appears to be
diet-controlled as an out-patient.
