1.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient had an
initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**4-11**] which showed a
big clot adherent to a large-sized hiatal hernia.  The clot
was too large to safely irrigate off.  Underneath the clot
could have been an ulcer erosion or [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.  In
the stomach, there was diffuse atrophy of the mucosa with no
bleeding noted; compatible with chronic atrophic gastritis.
There was no bleeding in the duodenum.

The patient was kept on strict nothing by mouth and
intravenous fluids, and her hematocrit levels were followed
to keep her hematocrit above 30.  Her hematocrit dropped
initially from 30.3 to 27.4 and then to 22.6.  She was
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells, and her
hematocrit has been stable since, ranging from 30 to 32, with
no further episodes of bleeding since [**4-12**].  She has
remained on a proton pump inhibitor (Protonix) twice per day.

A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed on [**4-14**]
showed still adherent clot about 8 cm in length and 2 cm in
width, adherent to a 2-cm length mucosa within the large
hiatal hernia.  There were no signs of active bleeding.
Electrocautery was applied to the base of the clot in an
attempt to dislodge it from the esophageal mucosa and for
hemostasis; however, despite the clot still remained adherent
to the esophageal mucosa.  It appeared that there may be an
ulceration and mucous in the area of the esophagus to which
the clot was adherent.  Otherwise, the stomach and the
duodenum were normal on the repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

The patient was kept nothing by mouth for the remaining
portion of [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**4-14**], and was continued on intravenous
fluids.  Since her hematocrit remained stable on the
following day ([**4-15**]), she was started on clear liquids in
the morning, and diet may be advanced to soft solids until
her repeat upper endoscopy next week which has already been
scheduled.

Since her hematocrit has been stable for the last several
days, the patient is safe to be discharged to home or to
rehabilitation.

An upper endoscopy followup has been scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21140**]
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2161**] at the Endoscopy Unit on the [**Location (un) 448**] of
[**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] One [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] Building on [**2104-5-8**] at 9:30
a.m.  The patient should not have anything to eat after
midnight on [**2104-5-7**] and should not eat breakfast on the
morning of [**2104-5-8**] (on the morning of the
esophagogastroduodenoscopy).

Her aspirin and Plavix should be held considering her
gastrointestinal bleed, and restarting of these two
medications will be made after her repeat endoscopy on [**5-8**].  The patient should remain on Protonix 40 mg by mouth
twice per day until her repeat endoscopy, and she should
avoid nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs until her
procedure.  The patient will also probably benefit from a
colonoscopy as an outpatient.  Helicobacter pylori antibody
was still pending.

2.  THROMBOCYTOPENIA ISSUES:  Heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia antibody was positive, so the patient should
not receive any heparin.  The patient has a history of a mild
pancytopenia in the past, and this issue was discussed
between the patient and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] of Hematology/Oncology,
and it was decided that no bone marrow biopsy would be
performed.  The patient should follow up as an outpatient
with her primary care physician to insure that she has a rise
in her platelets.

3.  HYPERKALEMIA ISSUES:  The patient had an initial
potassium value of 6 with peaked T waves on
electrocardiogram.  This was thought to likely be due to
dehydration, and the blood sample was also moderately
hemolyzed.  Otherwise, her potassium has remained stable.

4.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient does have
an element of diastolic dysfunction, and so her fluid status
was carefully monitored a she was getting significant amounts
of fluids and packed red blood cells.  She has maintained
stable oxygenation, and good oxygen saturations, as well as
good urine output.

5.  COAGULOPATHY ISSUES:  The patient developed an INR of
1.4; likely secondary to being nothing by mouth for many days
and deficiency in vitamin K.  She has been given by mouth
vitamin K and should continue this for two more days.  Her
INR will likely decrease when she receives adequate
nutrition.

6.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  As mentioned above,
aspirin and Plavix were being held secondary to a large
gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient should continue to hold
these two medications until her repeat endoscopy on [**5-8**];
at which time the decision as to whether to restart these
medications can be made.  The patient has been restarted on
her beta blocker.  She will continue with her statin, Imdur
beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor.

7.  CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient's
creatinine is at baseline.  Her blood urea nitrogen was
likely increased secondary to bleeding and has now returned
to [**Location 213**].

8.  LEFT LEG PAIN ISSUES:  The patient had a previous zoster
infection that was treated with Valtrex.  On admission, she
had no evidence of a zoster infection with no rashes
apparent.  The patient has multiple musculoskeletal
complaints that have been chronic.  She was continued on her
Neurontin for neuropathic pain.  The patient was also given
Tylenol for pain control.   She does not have an active
zoster infection.

9.  PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her
BuSpar.  She has multiple somatic complaints; likely anxiety
related.

10.  ACIDOSIS/FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The
patient's acidosis was improving as her diarrhea improved.
It will likely continue to improve as she maintains a normal
diet and her diarrhea continues to decrease.   She was
started on a clear diet on [**4-15**] following her
esophagogastroduodenoscopy since her hematocrit has been
stable.

11.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on
pneumatic boots and a proton pump inhibitor.  The patient
should not receive any heparin secondary to positive
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody.

12.  ACCESS ISSUES:  The patient has difficult access issues
and two peripheral intravenous lines through most of her
stay.

13.  CODE STATUS ISSUES:  The patient is a full code.

14.  DISPOSITION ISSUES:  At the time of this dictation, a
Physical Therapy consultation has recommended benefit from
rehabilitation for maximum safety.  The patient is being
screened for rehabilitation at the time of this dictation.
