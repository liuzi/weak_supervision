Neuro:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented to the ED on [**2167-2-21**] following 2 weeks of
headaches, nausea/vomiting, and vertigo. CT head demonstrated a
large mass in the R cerebellum and a smaller lesion in the third
ventricle. Neurosurgery was consulted in the ED and declined
acute intervention. She was started on Decadron 4mg Q6 and
admitted to the neuro-ICU for monitoring. She did well overnight
without any evidence of hydrocephalus or increasing ICP, and her
symptoms began to improve. She was transferred to the neurology
floor on [**2167-2-22**].

MRI with and without contrast was performed which demonstrated
three lesions, largest in R cerebellar hemisphere as well as two
additional masses in third ventricle and left insula.
Neuro-oncology was consulted and recommended resection of
cerebellar lesion and whole brain radiation.
Her primary oncologists Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 11309**] were also
contact[**Name (NI) **].
Neurosurgery recommended suboccipital craniectomy followed by
VPS placement.

On [**2167-2-24**]: she had increased nausea and headaches. She was taken
to the OR and underwent resection of her cerebellar mass. She
tolerated the procedure well. Post operatively she returned to
the ICU for SBP control and neurochecks. Her exam remained
stable and post operative head CT showed no hemorrhage. On [**2-25**]
she was transferred to the floor. On [**2-26**] she had a routine head
CT for preoperative planning and this showed no change from
previous scans. She was kept NPO after midnight for VPS
placement on [**2-27**].

On [**2167-2-27**]: she was taken to the operating room for VP shunt
placement. She tolerated the procedure well. Post-operatively
she returned to the floor.

Postop MRI demonstrated residual cerebellar tumor and so on [**3-4**]
she returned to the OR for craniotomy for excision of residual
tumor.

On [**3-5**], patient was doing well, having some hallunications, but
knows that they are hallunications. Her decadron was tappered
and she was transferred to the floor. Her exam remains stable;
SQH was started as well.
