69F with HX SVT, ESRD, CAD, PAD, and sCHF p/w symptomatic atrial
tachycardia to the 130s during outpatient dialysis; admitted for
management of this chronic problem, previously refractory to
pharmacologic therapy and a 1st ablation attempt on [**2124-3-2**];
during this admission she underwent a 2nd ablation attempt which
was not wholly successful (some intermittent Atach episodes
thereafter), and which was c/b a post-procedure R femoral AVF.
.
# ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA
Admitted from HD w/atrial tachycardia, a chronic intermittent
issues. Usually asymptomatic; now symptomatic w/lightheadedness
at HD. Admission EKG here documented atrial tachycardia to the
130s, no ischemic changes. Hemodynamically stable and
asymptomatic despite HR intermittently to the 130s. Underwent
successful ablation here on [**2124-3-16**], after which she was in NSR
for >24h. However, she did flip into atrial tachycardia
intermittently thereafter, with HR max 120s - episodes
self-resolved, occurred primarily during HD, and were
asymptomatic. Attempts to increase beta-blockade beyond Toprol
75mg PO QD were limited by BP. Patient will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
(electrophysiologist) in outpatient follow-up in ~1 week to
discuss any possible future intervenion. In the interim, at home
and at HD, her inpatient cardiologist felt comfortable
tolerating asymptomatic atrial tachycardia to the 120s-130s.
We note that on [**3-16**], post-procedure recovery was initially
complicated by anaesthesia-induced hypotension (requiring
overnight ICU obs) and later by the slow development of a R
femoral AVF (documented by ultrasound, see results). For the R
femoral AVF, vascular surgery consult service evaluated her
daily and recommended conservative management vascular surgery
f/u in 4 weeks. Expect spontaneous resolution.

# CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE, LVEF 20%
TTE during this admission demonstrated LVEF 20%, MR 4+ TR 4+,
all worse than prior. MR [**First Name (Titles) 9413**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on exam. Ischemic vs.
tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy suspected as underlying
cause. She was euvolemic during admission; volume/BP control
primarily via BB and dialysis. Imdur was stopped due to relative
hypotension (SBP 90s-110s). Metoprolol dose increased to Toprol
75 mg QD. We note hx lisinopril allergy; considered started [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] but deferred this for outpatient f/u in setting of
borderline BPs.
.
# ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION
Patient's BP fell to 75/palp when working w/PT on [**3-20**]. Family
confirmed that she suffers from lightheadedness when she first
rises to stand, especially after watching television (she like
Westerns). Imdur had already been stopped prior to this PT eval;
BB was subsequently lowered from Toprol 100 QD to 75 QD (further
decrease thought inappropriate given need to control atrial
tachycardia). She worked with PT twice more and was instructed
on techniques to decrease orthostatic symptoms and prevent
falls. Outpatient PT arranged at discharge.
.
# DM2
Patient has known DM2, not on either oral hypoglycemics or
insulin. Insulin needs here ranged from 8-12U/day. Discussed
initiating insulin w/pt, but she refused. [**Month (only) 116**] require ongoing BS
evaluation/discussion of therapeutic options as an outpatient.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES
.
# CAD
Patient w/ significant 2V CAD (LAD stented w/BMS x2, RCA
occluded 100% on [**9-/2123**] cath). EKGs negative for evidence of
restenosis or ischemic changes. No chest pain or dyspnea.
Continued Plavix and ASA 81mg.
.
# CHRONIC ANEMIA
Chronic; family confirms that she receives Epo at outpatient HD.
Denies h/o melena or GI bleeding. Hct remained stable ~30.
.
# ESRD:
Longstanding, on qMWF schedule. No difficulty w/LUE AV fistula
access. Atrial tachycardia episodes occurred primarily during HD
sessions, were asymptomatic and self-resolved within minutes.
See above for cardiology plan re: any future asymptomatic ATach
during HD.
.
# Hx Hypothyroidism s/p thyroidectomy
TSH wnl at admission. Continued home dose of synthroid.
.
# Hx HLD
Continued home statin.
.
# Hx Seizure disorder
One seizure in the past per patient. Continued home Keppra. No
seizure activity observed.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
1. EP to reassess for possible future repeat ablation attempt
2. DM2 - Pt refused discussion of insulin, had 8-12U/day insulin
requirement. [**Month (only) 116**] need further discussion/education about risks
of continuing with dietary control and without any medical
management.
3. Worsening sCHF (35%->20%). Suspected declining LVEF due to
tachycardia-induced crdiomyopathy [**2-17**] long-standing Atrial
Tachycardia. Suggest repeat TTE in [**4-21**] mos to reassess LVEF, MR
and TR once rate better controlled.
4. Follow-up HR, BP, orthostatic VS. Toprol dose increased to
75mg po DAILY, imdur stopped.
5. Follow-up logistics of outpatient PT, recommended by
inpatient PT consult
6. Monitor exam for changes in R femoral AVF (vascular surgery
f/u arranged)
6.
