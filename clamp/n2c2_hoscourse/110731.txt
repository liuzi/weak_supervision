Mr [**Known lastname 80675**] was admitted to the SICU for close observation and
prepared for a left sided cranitomy for evacuation of subdural
hematoma. On [**4-1**] he underwent a craniotomy.  Post operatively he
was monitored for 24 hours in the SICU his exam improved with no
drift or weakness. On his first post operative day he was
transferred to the surgical floor. He was tolerating a regular
diet, PT eval stated pt was safe to go home. However family was
uncomfortable taking pt home and was requesting rehab. During
evaluation for re-hab on POD 5 he then developed severe
dysarthria. Repeat head CT was unchanged and MRI/MRA of brain
and neck were negative for stroke. His EEG was also negative.
Over the next few days his speech/word finding improved. He did
wax and wane with periods of aphasia and normal speech. There
was concern for seizure so a 24hr EEG was done and shows normal
activity.  CT scan on day of discharge [**2179-4-12**] = stable.
Staples and sutures were removed from crani site.  Site without
erythema. Plan is for discharge home today with [**Name (NI) 269**] - pt and
family agree with this plan.  His exam remains non-focal.
