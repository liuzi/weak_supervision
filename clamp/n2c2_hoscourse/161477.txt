30 yo male with HTN, hypokalemia, CKDIII, h/o untreated positive
PPD presents with few days abdominal pain that has now resolved
with 2-3 months weight loss, bilateral leg edema, anorexia found
to have anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure,
hypoalbuminemia, symmetric diffuse lymphadenopathy and volume
overload with exam suggestive of acute diastolic heart failure.
Concerned for neoplastic and, chronic inflammatory, or
infectious processes.
.
# Acute diastolic heart failure: He was noted to be in acute
diastolic heart failure on transfer from the ICU. He was given
lasix 40 mg iv x 1, and continued on a 20 mg iv daily regimen,
then was transitioned to 40mg PO daily. Daily weights and I/O's
were followed. His blood pressure was controlled as below; in
particular, he was started on beta blocker, resumed on an ACEI
(which he apparently did not fill at his pharmacy), and started
on spironolactone as well. His O2 requirement was weaned off.
.
# Hypoalbuminemia: possibly renal or primary GI. Nothing on
history to suggest primary GI protein losing enteropathy though
this should be considered (i.e. celiac sprue, lymphoma, IBD,
amyloid etc.) especially in light of improving renal function
which argues against primary renal protein loss, low albumin,
absence of known liver disease and weight loss. SPEP/UPEP
negative. Anti-TTG IgA negative. Pt should discuss need for
colonoscopy with his PCP given anemia, weight loss and age.
.
# Gram positive bacteremia, unclear source: He was initially
started on vanc, but this was d/c'd when this culture latered
speciated with coagulase negative staph. No subsequent cultures
had growth.
.
#non-specific enteritis-seen on CT scan. This likely explains
reports of abdominal pain and diarrhea recently. Pt's abdominal
pain resolved. He did not have diarrhea and stool studies were
negative. Symptoms resolved and pt was tolerating a regular
diet.
.
# Weight Loss - 25-30lb. Large DDx. Concerning for primary
neoplastic vs. GI-infectious vs. GI/systemic infectious. See
above. Nothing on history/exam to suggest primary rheumatologic
disorder, ESR 13, [**Doctor First Name **] negative. He was scheduled for a lymph
node biopsy (his R inguinal lymph node seemed the largest),
excisional by surgery. However, he refused this. Contact[**Name (NI) **] legal
guardian [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as well as PCP regarding this issue. Pt
initially stated he did not have enlarged lymph nodes. However,
later on he stated that he knew the reason to biopsy the lymph
nodes was to look for "cancer" and then stated that he would
never have a biospy. Discussed this with patient's PCP and legal
guardian who did not want to force (by physical or chemical
restraint) the patient to undergo a procedure against his will.
Discussed possibility of biopsy with the patient multiple times
and he did decline, but agrees to follow up with his PCP for
further evaluation.
.
# Acute Renal Failure w/ proteinuria: Lack of schistocytes on
initial smear argued against TTP etiology. Likely pre-renal,
perhaps due to poor po intake. unclear if he was hypotensive in
the ED. FENa suggested prerenal etiology. Creatinine improved to
baseline. He should have chemistries/electrolytes followed after
discharge. Creatinine on discharge 1.6.
.
# Altered mental status, from opiates received in the ED now
resolved. He was initially admitted to the ICU given his
unresponsiveness after opiates. This resolved after being given
narcan and never reoccurred.
.
# Anemia - His B12, folate, and iron were normal. Smear was
checked in ICU and only rare schistocytes were seen. HIV Ab was
negative. His hematocrit was stable on monitoring and was 30.1
on day of discharge without evidence of bleeding. This is likely
due CKD. However, given recent abdominal pain and anemia pt
should undergo a colonoscopy.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - He was found to have thrombocytopenia,
thought to be subacute, given that he had 130K one month ago.
His platelets were monitored and normalized. Splenomegaly not
noted on imaging. HIV negative. Could have been due to
medications or acute illness.
.
# Ascites - new finding. Had not been tapped b/c ICU felt not
tappable. No known chronic liver disease or cirrhosis.
Considered lymphoma, occult cirrhosis, TB peritonitis on
differential given +PPD, abdominal pain, weight loss. TB
enteritis normal affects IC valve area which he does not
radiographically/clinically have. RUQ US was without significant
ascites, not enough to tap; no cirrhosis noted. This could be
due to heart failure, but is likely due to low albumin.
Quantiferon gold PENDING at time of discharge.
.
# Hypertension - He was continued on his home regimen, although
it was found that he wasn't filling these prescriptions as an
outpt. Given proteinuria, he was (re-)started on an ACE-I. He
was also started on spironolactone given his heart failure and
hypertension (after drawing renin and aldosterone). He was
started on beta blocker given dCHF.
- With chronic hypokalemia, sent renin / aldosterone levels
since these have never been sent, to rule out
hyperaldonsteronism. These are still PENDING at time of
discharge.
.
# Hypokalemia- see above, concern for hyperaldo. Repleted dialy.
Pt started on spironolactone and still required supplementation
of potassium. Suggested to decrease home potassium regimen by
[**2-8**] given CKD and use of spironolactone. Pt should have his
potassium checked regularly.
.
# Lymphadenopathy - bilateral inguinal and axillary. He denied
fevers and chills, but noted weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, ahnd
elevated LDH,  suggested biopsy to r/o TB, lymphoma (with flow
cytommetry), etc.  Surgery prepared for excisional biopsy of LN,
but pt refused. Pt refused on multiple occasions. See above. PCP
and legal guardian did not want to for pt to undergo procedures
and testing that he did not want. Pt was aware that biopsy was
suggested to r/o cancer.
.
# Positive PPD (untreated) - CXR was performed without note of
tuberculous disease INH is contraindicated in G6PD deficiency.
.
# Pericardial Effusion - likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia.
Mild per ECHO (not large as reported on CT), no signs of
tamponade. Other DDx = TB (though usually much larger), other
Rheum disorders (unlikely by hx/exam). This was likely due to
hypoalbumenemia.
.
# Long QT: Present also on EKG [**2178-5-8**]. His potassium was
repleted. QTC remained ~440 with haldol dosing. Serial EKG were
performed. Pt's haldol dose was decreased to 5mg from 10mg due
to this. EKG's should be monitored in outpatient setting.
.
# Lacunar infarct, clincally quiescent: Seen on head CT, and new

since [**2173**]. Would recommend outpatient workup for PFO, etc.
.
# Psych: schizophrenia, formerly pleasant did become
inexplicably agitated about prospect of getting LN biopsy. Pt
found to lack capacity by psychiatry and found to have a legal
guardian-[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]. Pt's guardian was updated on pt's
clinical course and as above did not want to pursue restraints
(physical/chemical) in order to enforce biopsy. Pt was taken off
his depakote during admission given altered mental status and
this should be resumed upon discharge. Pt's haldol was decreased
to 5mg from 10mg given above. Pt remained pleasant throughout
the remainder of the hospitalization.
