   Mr. [**Known lastname 111746**] presented to the ED on [**6-19**] at [**Hospital3 **] for BRBPR.  Admission labs were notable for a Hct of
54.4 with WBC of 22.5. During his brief hospital course his Hct
continued to drop (to a low of 26) warranting a total of 3 PRBC
transfusions. The patient was evaluated by both the Oncology and
Gastroenterology teams and a upper endoscopy was performed on
hospital day 1 - notable for a large bleeding mass located in
the GE junction. Biopsies were performed and given the high
concern for malignancy the patient was prepared for transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] SICU for further management.
  Here, he was found to be hemodynamically stable.  His
hematocrit dropped from 30.9 on [**6-19**] to 24.7 on [**6-21**], so he was
transfused a unit of pRBCs.  His hematocrit stabilized and he
was transferred to the floor.  On [**6-22**], he underwent a
colonoscopy to evaluate for a lower GI bleed given his initial
presentation.  The colonoscopy showed dark melenic-appearing
stool in the whole colon and terminal ileum, non-bleeding
diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, non-bleeding internal
hemorrhoids, and otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and
terminal ileum.  He tolerated the procedure well.  On [**6-23**], the
foley was discontinued, but the patient failed to void and
required reinsertion.  Also, an endoscopic ultrasound was
attempted but failed due to patient agitation.  The patient
apparently had an undocumented drug side effect of the
lorazepam, which resulted in two code purples being called.
Throughout the entire time, the patients vital signs were within
normal limits and stable, including oxygen saturation (once the
measurement was obtainable - originally the patient was refusing
pulse ox).  The patient was discharged on [**6-24**] in stable
condition with a leg bag in place.  His daughter declined our
offer to schedule him with a nearby urologist to follow up on
the leg bag because they live in [**Location (un) 5087**].  She was informed that
it is very important, therefore, that he follow up with his PCP
quickly to get a referral to a urologist in Hindham to manage
the leg bag.  Mr. [**Known lastname 111746**] was discharged in stable condition.
