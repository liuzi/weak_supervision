Note - this hospital course reflects the course as reflected in
the chart and here summarized by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from [**Location (un) 1131**] through
the medical record.  I (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was the attending of record
only from [**12-1**] through [**2192-12-3**].
.
50 yo generally healthy female, p/w N/V, fever, hypotension,
erythroderma and sepsis on admission requiring pressor support
and agressive hydration on presentation with ICU admission.
.
Sepsis: felt to be due to toxic shock associated with tampon
use.  Cervical cx. showed MSSA, all other cultures were
negative.  Pt. recieved Vancomycin, clindamycin, and zosyn
initially.  She improved hemodynamically and abx were tapered to
clindamycin po and she was transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **], at
which time wbc again rose with eosinophilia, this was changed to
cefalexin for one day.  As WBC continued to rise, all abx were
stopped.  At this time a morbilliform drug erruption was noted
truncally, and eosinophilia persisted.  These began to resolve
by d/c with discontinuation of all abx.  At time of d/c, pt. had
been afebrile for over 72 hours, all surveillance cx were
negative, and she was feeling well.

Her ICU course was complicated by mild acute renal failure that
improved with fluids, as well as mild pulmonary edema,
attributed to massive IV fluid resuscutation on presentation,
which resolved over time with auto diuresis.
