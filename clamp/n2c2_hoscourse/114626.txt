72 yo female with severe ventricular dysfunction (EF 10%)
secondary to polysubstance abuse and HIV (last CD4 359) who
presented with bradycardia secondary to digoxin and amiodarone
toxicity.
 .
# Rhythm: Found to be bradycardic to 30's in ED in setting of
digoxin toxicity with amiodarone and hyperkalemia contributing.
Patient had been started on amiodarone at her last
hospitalization due to runs of VTach.  Pacer pads were placed
but she did not require transcutaneous pacing.  An isoproterenol
drip was started which increased her Heart rates to 50's-60's
(although initially remained in junctional rhythm).  Digoxin and
amiodarone were held.  An attempt was made to place a temporary
pacing wire, but this attempt was unsuccessful because of
thrombosed veins.  The isoprotenenol drip was stopped on [**8-18**].
Patient will not go home on amiodarone and will go home on
Digoxin 0.125 mg qod.
.
# Pump: EF 10% on last echo ([**2136-8-3**]).  She appeared euvolemic
on admission so lasix was held.  She developed increased
shortness of breath and CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema,
so patient was diuresed with lasix. A foley catheter was placed
to monitor accurate I/Os. Digoxin and ACEI were held. ACEI will
be held until she follows up in clinic with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].

# CAD: No evidence of active ischemia during admission. Normal
perfusion images in [**2133**].

# HIV: Last CD4 359 in 04/[**2136**].  Patient requested that her
[**Year (4 digits) 2775**] therapy be stopped as she felt that this made her
nauseated and gave her abdominal discomfort.  Her PCP was
[**Name (NI) 653**] and made aware that the [**Name (NI) 2775**] was stopped.  Her
bactrim prophylaxis was continued.  She will follow-up with her
PCP [**2136-8-23**] to discuss further treatment options.

# Polysubstance abuse: Last use [**6-10**] mos PTA.  Continued with
methadone 90mg.

# ARF on CRI: Baseline creatinine 1.3-1.5. Now ARF on CRI;
likely secondary to bradycardia and low EF in setting of digoxin
toxicity.  Held lasix and ACEI initially. Creatine continues to
trend towards baseline with return of home lasix dose.

#) Hyperkalemia: likely [**3-9**] ARF on CRI.  Held ACEI.  Avoided
Calcium in setting of digoxin toxicity.  Monitored frequent
electrolytes.  Treated with kayxalate as needed.  She will have
her potassium monitored on [**8-22**] at the rehab facility.

#) Anticoagulation: Patient started on coumadin given poor LV
function and risk of clot formation.  Continued coumadin at
decreased dose with sub-therapeutic INR.  Prior to discharge to
rehab, coumadin was increased to 5mg daily.  Her INR will be
checked on [**8-22**] at rehab and coumadin will be adjusted by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 437**].
