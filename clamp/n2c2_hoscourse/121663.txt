51yo M w/ hypotension and bradycardia, likely in setting of CCB
and BB for his newly diagnosed afib.
.
# CV:
* Rhythm: Mr. [**Known lastname 107906**] bradycardia was likely due to excessive
nodal blockade from CCB and BB since he recovered his rate and
BP off all nodal blocking agents. He then went back into rapid
afib, with HR up to 160s despite the addition of BB. His BP
remained stable so the decision was made to attempt
cardioversion. TEE showed no clot and DCCV was attempted but he
was only able to maintain NSR for ~30 sec. He continued to be in
afib w/ RVR, with a rate as high as 160-170. Diltiazem 30mg PO
QID was added, still with insufficient control of his rate. The
diltiazem dose was then increased to 60mg TID on [**1-6**] due to
persistent tachycardia with good effect on his rate. EP was
consulted to help guide the management of his arrhythmia and
they recommended discontinuing his diltiazem and instead
attempting to control his rhythm (and rate) with amiodarone. He
was started on 400mg PO TID x1 week, with the plan to decrease
to [**Hospital1 **] dosing x1 week then QD dosing. Once he had received an
adequate amiodarone load, the plan was to attempt another DCCV
as an outpatient. Mr. [**Known lastname **] discussed this plan with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 73**] who also wanted him to wear [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor
upon discharge. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was instructed in the use of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
of Hearts monitor and was told to send in rhythm strips to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 73**] daily, so his rate and his intervals could be
monitored daily. Despite the initiation of amiodarone, Mr.
[**Known lastname **] also needed a beta-blocker to keep his rate under
control. His beta-blocker was slowly increased up to 75mg PO QID
and was then switched to Toprol XL 300mg PO QD prior to
discharge. The Toprol XL and amiodarone allowed Mr. [**Known lastname **] to
achieve a resting heart rate of 90-100s. Coumadin was started on
[**1-4**] with a goal INR of [**1-7**]. He was kept on a heparin gtt until
his INR was therapeutic. He was discharged on 3mg of coumadin
daily, and his INR on discharge was 2.4.
.
* Pump: Although Mr. [**Known lastname **] had no evidence of heart failure by
exam (lungs were CTAB and his JVP was flat), his OSH ECHO and
TEE here showed a depressed EF. After receiving IVF in the ER,
he had some swelling in his hands and feet which resolved on its
own. He never required diuresis with lasix.
.
* Ischemia: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has no evidence of ischemia. His CE
enzymes were negative x2. EKG has no evidence of ST or T wave
changes.
.
# ARF: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was in mild ARF on admission, w/ Cr of 1.5 and
K of 5.8. It resolved after receiving several liters of IVF in
the ER. It was most likely prerenal +/- ATN from hypotension.
His Cr was 1.2 on discharge (lowest value was 1.0 during his
stay).
.
# FEN: He follwed a regular heart-healthy diet. No IVF were
needed. His electrolytes were checked daily and were repleted
prn to keep K >4 and Mg >2.
.
# ACCESS: He had a centrail line (R IJ) placed in the ER
initially, but it was pulled after TEE/DCCV. He then had
peripheral IVs for IV access.
.
# PPX: He was on heparin gtt as a bridge to coumadin until his
INR was therapeutic. He had a bowel regimen. No PPI was
indicated.

# DISPO: To home, with [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor. Will follow up in
Dr.[**Name (NI) 107907**] office for INR checks.
