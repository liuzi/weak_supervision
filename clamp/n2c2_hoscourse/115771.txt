Assessment and Plan: 44 year old man with ETOH abuse transferred
from OSH with necrotizing pancreatitis, ETOH withdrawal and DTs,
fever and GPC bacteremia.
.
#. Necrotizing Pancreatitis: Patient initially presented with
abdominal pain and nausea and vomiting with lipase>3000 and
evidence of pancreatic 20-30% necrosis on CT scan. US without
stones. Surgery evaluated him and elected for conservative
management. With high fever and level of necrosis, meropenim was
started at the OSH. A 7 day course of this was completed. His
abd pain is now mostly resolved. He has developed an appetite,
but given the level of necrosis seen on the CT scan the mild DM
that he has developed it was recommended by surgery that he get
jejunal tube feedings for at least another week. After that
time, clears should be introduced and diet advanced, and if not
tolerated, TF resumed. He is followed by gastroenterology, Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2523**] MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 86328**] for his crohn's disease and she
will follow him for his pancreatitis as well. Of note, at the
time of discharge his LFT's had returned to [**Location 213**] and his WBC's
had come down to 14 from a high of 22.
.
# ETOH Withdrawal/abuse: Patient reportedly agitated at OSH
secondary to ETOH withdrawal and has reported heavy daily ETOH
intake. No prior h/o withdrawal but has been in active
withdrawal there on ativan drip and also getting haldol for
agitation. Last ETOH [**12-22**] or [**12-23**]. Pt arrived to the ICU with
significance somnolence, minimally responsive but protecting his
airway. We d/c'd ativan drip and changed to valium PO as
tolerated. Pt's mental status significantly improved and patient
became more coherent.  CT head without acute changes. Continued
MVI, thiamine, folic acid. Strongly encouraged ETOH cessation.
At the time of discharge he was AAO x 3, awake, alert, and w/o
any s/s of withdrawal.
.
# GPC bacteremia: Most likely sources include catheter related
bloodstream infection given PICC line given TPN. Treated with
vanco and [**Last Name (un) 2830**] for now while awaiting speciation and
sensitivities, that returned as pansensative coag neg staph. He
was given ceftriaxone to complete a 2 week course to end [**1-10**]. A
midline was placed for this which should be removed after abx
therapy is complete.
.
# Fever/leukocytosis: Likely multifactorial secondary to
pancreatitis and bacteremia.  last check 14.
.

B12 injections, presumably from a newly diagnosed B12
deficiency. he received 1 week of daily injections, planning for
1 month of qweek followed by qmonth afterwards.
