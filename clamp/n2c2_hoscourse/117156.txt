Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 76F with DM, CAD, and h/o GIB who presents with
GIB and CP. She was admitted to the MICU for monitoring.
Hospital course is discussed below by problem:
.
1. Gastrointestinal bleed.
The history of BRBPR was more suggestive of a lower source. A
brisk upper bleed seemed less likely. Her baseline hct is 30,
and during this admission, it dropped to as low as 23.9. She had
small amounts of bright red blood in her stool, although nothing
to explain the 6 point hematocrit drop. A central line was
placed and she was transfused a total of 9 units PRBCs during
her six-day course in the unit. GI was consulted and performed
both upper endoscopy and colonoscopy, although no source of
active bleeding or old blood could be identified. The full
reports are provided above. She was started on IV proton-pump
inhibitor and her hematocrit stabilized in the low thirties on
the fifth hospital day, and remained stable with stable vital
signs. She was transferred to the floors on hospital day 6, and
her hematocrit followed twice daily. After transfer, she had no
more bloody bowel movements. Her Plavix has been held, and her
antihypertensives have also been held. She will follow-up in [**Hospital **]
clinic with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1356**] in one week.
.
2. Chest pain, coronary artery disease, history of CABG.
She has chronic chest pain, and is on 2 anti-anginal
medications. During this admission, she reported intermittent
episodes of angina. EKGs did not show acute changes and cardiac
enzymes were cycled and negative. Her ranolazine was continued
but her Imdur and SL nitros held for concern of precipitating
hypotension. She was transfused a total of 9 units PRBCs to keep
her hct above 25. As above, we have held her Plavix and
cardiovascular medicines at time of discharge given the recent
GI bleed. Her blood pressure has been well-controlled, despite
being off meds, with ranges in the 120s-140s/60-70s. She will
follow-up with her primary care where decision can be made
regarding resumption of her Plavix and CV meds.
.
3. Diabetes mellitus II.
We held her oral hypoglycemics and kept her on sliding scale
humalog insulin. She will resume her oral hypoglycemics after
discharge.
.
4. Hypertension.
As above, her metoprolol, Cozaar, Imdur and triamterene/HCTZ
were stopped in the setting of GI bleed. These can be resumed as
outpatient if her blood pressure warrants additional meds,
although during this admission her pressures have been
relatively well-controlled without.
.
5. Hyperlipidemia.
We continued her outpatient simvastatin.
.
Her diet was progressed as tolerated to diabetic, heart-healthy
diet. Pneumoboots were used for venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Her code status is full code.
