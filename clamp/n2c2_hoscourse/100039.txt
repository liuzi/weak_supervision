38 yo F w/ h/o ALL in remission s/p cord transplant in [**1-13**],
anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy (EF 15-20% [**1-14**]) and
recurrent nausea and vomiting who presents with 1 week abd pain,
acute on chronic renal failure and new hyperbilirubinemia.
Unclear unifying diagnosis.

# Acute on Chronic Abdominal Pain:  Pt noted to have significant
abdominal pain as well as increased [**Month/Year (2) 4394**] on admission.  Of
note, she had an extensive work up of her chronic abdominal pain
in the past with no clear cause.  Abdominal CT was unrevealing
for any obvious source of her pain. GI was consulted who
recommended a SBFT which did not reveal any significant
pathology.  GI recommended bentyl for antispasmodic effect.  She
was also continued on her home MS contin and IV morphine for
breakthrough.  Her pain persisted as did her [**Last Name (LF) 4394**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the
decision was made to perform a diagnositc paracentesis under
ultrasound guidance.  200ml peritoneal fluid was removed.  This
revealed 775 WBCs, but a lymphocytic/monocytic predominance with
only 1% polys making SBP unlikely.  Fluid was sent for culture
which showed no growth and flow cytometry which showed no
evidence of ALL recurrence.  Despite lack of evidence for SBP,
she was started on zosyn empirically which was stopped on [**5-2**].
She continued to have mild-moderate abdominal pain but was able
to eat full meals and had BMs. She was continued on her home
mscontin and morphine IR.
.
# Anthracycline-induced/ GVHD cardiomyopathy:  EF <20% on echo
from 2/[**2174**].  Pt was maintained on diuresis as above, which was
subsequently held in the setting of rising creatinine with
improvement in creatinine. Torsemide was slowly reintroduced and
uptitrated to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] which caused another bump in creatinine
to 3.0, so renal and cardiology were consulted. Renal ultrasound
was unrevealing.  She was then taken to the Cath lab and placed
on a milrinone/lasix gtt and transfered to the CCU. Her volume
overload slowly improved and her peripheral edema/ascites slowly
improved as well. A repeat echo showed improved EF to 40-45% on
the milrinone gtt. She was then started on solumedrol 30mg IV
due to a concern for GVHD directed towards myocardium.  After
further discussion between cardiology and her oncology team she
was also started on cellcept for further management of her GVHD.
 She did well on milrinone and lasix drip, but the drip was
stopped when her creatinine bumped to 3.0 and it was felt her
volume status was near maximization.  Her milrinone was then
discontiued and she was then transferred back to [**Hospital1 3242**] for further
management of her abdominal pain and GVHD.  She was continued on
torsemide for diuresis with close follow-up with her outpatient
cardiologist.  Of note, she had frequent alarms on telemetry for
tachycardia that cardiologist felt was mostly due to artifact;
her beta blocker was uptitrated.  Repeat TTE prior to discharge
showed an EF of 35-40%.  She was discharged home on cellcept and
prednisone for possible GVHD.

# Acute Renal Failure:  On admission Cr was 2.7 (recent baseline
was 2), but at last discharge Cr was 2.3.  Renal saw the patient
who thought this was likely from overdiuresis (home torsemide
regimen of 20mg [**Hospital1 **]) in conjunction with her [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] recommended
holding diuresis. Her Cr subsequently improved, but in the
setting of her worsening [**First Name3 (LF) 4394**] and her cardiomyopathy,
decision was made to slowly add back diuresis, and eventually
she was up titrated to toresemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **] and her [**Last Name (un) **] was
restarted.  With this, however, her Cr began to climb again to
3.0.  Given the delicate balance between her renal failure
cardiomyopathy, cardiology/renal were consulted. Given her
depressed EF, her rising Cr was thought to be [**3-9**] volume
overload. She was sent to the cath lab and started on a
milrinone/lasix gtt and transfered to the CCU with a goal
diuresis of 1L per day. She was actively diuresed on her
milrinone and lasix drip with a total net negative of close to
9L.  Her Cr then returned to baseline by time of discharge and
she was discharged home on torsemide.

# Hyperbilirubinemia:  Unclear cause, could have been related to
a viral infection but no transaminitis to support this.  RUQ u/s
without cause for pain. This trended down to normal values and
remained stable by time of discharge

# Leukocytosis: patient had uptrending WBC in setting of
starting solumedrol, clutures were sent which revealed no
growth.
.
# H/O Embolic Stroke:  Has new opening of PFO based on most
recent echo which likely contributed to her recent stroke.  She
was maintained on coumadin 4mg daily, but anticoagulation was
held on day of paracentesis and remained subtherapeutic for
several days, so she was maintained on a heparin drip to bridge
her to a therapeutic INR [**3-10**]. She was maintained on a decreased
dose of coumadin throughout hospital admission with INR within
goal between 2 and 3. She was arranged with follow-up at
outpatient [**Hospital3 **].
