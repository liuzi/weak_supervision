74M w/MMP as above admitted w/hyoglycemia, hypotension, and
low-grade fever 13d s/p circumcision.  It is not clear if his
glyburide was recently increased--this could be a primary
contributor to his presentation.  He has an evident ballantitis
which could also be contributing.
.
1) Hypoglycemia- Thought to be most likely [**1-26**] glyburide in the
context of recent illness and polypharmacy.  On the evening
following admission, his blood glucose levels were maintained at
normal levels with D51/2NS gtt titrated to q1 hour fingersticks.
 Glyburide's half life is 24 hours, and in keeping with this,
hypoglycemic effect wore out within 24 hours of admission.
Subsequently blood glucose levels were >200 and the dextrose
support was discontinued.  With the resolution of hypoglycemia,
sliding scale insulin was initiated.  After transfer from the
MICU, the patient had blood sugars > 250.  He was started on low
dose glipizide prior to discharge.  Although Glipizide still has
some interaction with voriconazole, it has less interaction that
Glyburide.  The patient had been on Glyburide and Voriconazole
for many years prior to this episode of hypoglycemia and it was
not clear why the patient had hypoglycemia.  The Glipizide was
started back after the patient was found to have blood sugars in
the 250 range.  He will be seen by his primary care doctor
shortly after discharge for further titration of meds.
.
2) UTI- The patient was started on IV ceftriaxone which would
cover both his UTI and balantitis.  Culture results were
negative.  The patient was discharged on PO Augmentin.
.
3) Balantitis- Patient was found to have balanitis after recent
circumcision approximately 2 weeks prior to this admission.  A
swab gram stain negative.  The wound culture was found to grown
Diptheroids (Corynebacterium) and Coag Negative Staph consistent
with skin floral.  The patient was continued on a topical
antifungal as well as IV Ceftriaxone.  Additionally, a DFA was
negative for HSV.  The patient was discharged on PO Augmentin
and will followup with his [**Hospital1 2025**] Urologist.
.
4) Thrombocytopenia:  Thought to be [**1-26**] drug effect of
voriconazole vs. ranitidine; however, per PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 2025**], he has had
baseline thrombocytopenia.  Thrombocytopenia has been mentioned
as a rare side effect of vori, but per ID's assessment of risks
vs. benefits, would not stop Voriconazole.  At [**Hospital1 18**], patient's
ranitidine was stopped to see what effect it would have on
platelets.  Patient's platelets rose from 60s-80s at baseline to
112, making Ranitidine a possible cause of the patient's
thrombocytopenia.  The patient was instructed not to take
Ranitidine anymore.  He will followup at [**Hospital1 2025**] for further
monitoring of his thrombocytopenia.
.
5) Pulmunary aspergillosis- The patient was continued on
lifelong voriconazole therapy for history of pulmonary
aspergillosis.
.
6) Thrush- Patient was thought to have evidence of oral thrush
upon admission to the MICU.  He was continued on voriconazole
and nystatin S&S was added to his regimen.  He had no further
evidence of thrush upon transfer to the floor from the MICU.
.
7) Afib/SSS- Has PPM but currently native sinus driven.  The
patient was anticoagulated with warfarin.  Flecainide was
continued as per his outpatient regimen.
.
8) S/P renal xplant- Patient was continued on his
immunosupressives, Tacrolimus.  He was continued on Bactrim for
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  He will followup with his renal doctor at [**Hospital3 5870**] upon discharge.
