84 yo male with PMHx sx for lymphoma, upper GIB, cardiomyopathy,
who presented with an upper GI bleed with multiple gastric
ulcers seen on endoscopy, likely secondary to NSAID use and
recent high dose prednisone with CHOP therapy for lymphoma.
Patient was also found to have a silent STEMI, with V3 elevation
and elevated CE.
.
Upper GI bleed: Patient's UGI bleed was likely [**1-24**] NSAID use
combined with recent prednisone for CHOP. Patient was transfused
several units while in the MICU for hematocrit drop from 29.9 to
20.8 on presentation. Patient had an NG lavage performed, which
did not clear after 1000cc NS were infused. An emergent upper
endoscopy demonstrated ulcers in the antrum and stomach body,
lymphoid hyperplasia in the duodenal bulb, and mucosa suggestive
of Barrett's esophagus. Patient's ulcers were clipped, injected
with epinephrine, and had thermal therapy which stopped the
bleeding. Biopsy wasn't performed at the time due to concern for
increased bleeding.
On transfer to OMED, patient was hemodynamically stable, but
then began to have drop in hematocrit. He received three units
of blood, without an appropriate increase in hematocrit. He
remained guaiac positive, had two large bore pIVs for access,
and continued on [**Hospital1 **] pantoprazole. He had serial hematocrits
checked, and was stable for 48 hours prior to discharge.
Patient was scheduled for outpatient endoscopy to reassess the
ulcers, and for biopsy of the lymphoid hyperplasia. Patient was
advised to avoid all NSAIDs. He will have serial hematocrits
checked by home VNA.
.
STEMI: Patient was admitted with initial STE in V3, but with a
progressive rise in cardiac enzymes. He was noted to have
evolving ST changes since admission with peak troponin, and was
diagnosed as having a STEMI. A cardiology consult was obtained,
and recommended stopping patient's amlodipine and digoxin, and
starting atorvastatin, lisinopril and metoprolol, which were
started when patient was hemodynamically stable from a GI bleed
perspective. Patient's cardiac enzymes were trended, and he was
found to have continued upward trend in troponin to peak 2.24,
with gradual decrease in CK and CKMB. Cardiology was
reconsulted, and felt that elevation in troponin was not an
indication for cardiac catheterization, and opted for medical
management. Patient was not placed on heparin due to bleeding
risk. He was not anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation due
to bleeding risk, and due to concern for poor compliance as an
outpatient.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed, which showed global
hypokinesis and a depressed EF from 40% to 30-35%, possibly from
stunned myocardium. He will need to have follow up with his
outpatient cardiologist. He remained on telemetry with no
events. He will need a stress test as an outpatient. He remained
chest pain free through his admission.
.
Lymphoma: Patient's lymphoma was stable. He received one dose of
neupogen as an inpatient, but had a leukocytosis. He will be
seen in [**Hospital 20722**] clinic for consideration of further
chemotherapy. Patient will be seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5565**]
as an outpatient.
.
Patient remained full code. His diet was advanced as tolerated.
His electrolytes were monitored carefully and repleted.
Communication was with patient, and son Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2578**] [**Known lastname **]. C:
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 21950**] H: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21951**]. Patient was seen by physical and
occupational therapy. He will be seen by physical therapy at
home for services.
