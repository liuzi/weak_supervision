The patient was admitted to the MICU with a diagnosis of sepsis
and community acquired pneumonia. He had a long and complicated
hospital course that will be described by system.

1. Respiratory: The patient was intubated on the day of
admission for hypoxic respiratory failure presumably related to
sepsis and CAP in the setting of baseline CHF. In the ED, the
patient received a dose of ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and
vancomycin. He was initially continued on Vancomycin and also
started on Levaquin for ABx coverage for presumed community
acquired pneumonia. Blood cultures drawn on the date of
admission [**10-4**] showed 1/2 bottles positive for Staph Coag Neg.
Further blood cultures were negative. He then developed
ventilator associated pneumonia with MRSA. He was given
Linezolid for coverage of MRSA and completed a 2-week course on
[**2162-10-25**].  He required trach placement on [**2162-10-25**] for failure
to wean. His sputum cultures were repeatedly positive for MRSA
and pseudomonas and enterobacter cloacea througout his
hospitalization. He was treated with vancomycin and meropenem
from [**2162-10-31**] through [**2162-11-13**]. The vancomycin was restarted on
[**2162-11-15**] after he spiked a fever and had MRSA in sputum again and
this was continued until his discharge. He was started on
ceftazidime on [**2162-11-23**] and that was also continued until his
discharge.  He was also treated with Flagyl early in the
hospitalization for presumed aspiration pneumonia. Most recent
sputum cultures from [**2162-11-29**] were positive for MRSA and
pseudomonas sensitive to ceftazidime. His latest ventilator
settings were AC/0.4/TV=600/RR=10/PEEP=5. He had repeated trials
with a Passy-Miur valve that were unsuccessful leading to
coughing fits.

2. CV: The patient was initially hypotensive at the time of
admission, likely related to sepsis +/- possible adrenal
insufficiency. On admission, he was started on stress dose
steroids and overnight remained on dopamine. The patient was
able to be weaned off pressors after the first night, but
subsquently required intermitent use of pressors to maintain his
SBP.

2.1. Rhythm: He was in afib with a rapid ventricular response on
admisison that was treated with a diltiazem drip, lopressor and
digoxin. He developed polymorphic VT with a transition to Vfib
on [**2162-10-23**] that responded to defibrillation. He was started on
a lidocaine drip and then switched to amiodarone. The amiodarone
dose was decreased on [**2162-11-28**] in attempt to decrease the beta
blocker effect in the face of CHF. He is to remain on Amiodarone
200 mg PO daily. He also went into atrial fibrillation early in
the hospital course that resolved with discontinuation of
dobutamine. He was in normal sinus rhythm at the time of
discharge.

3. Mitral Regurgitation: Per echo he has 4+ MR, which has been
refractory to medical therapy. Fluid overload was a major issue.
He underwent ultrafiltation in the CCU for several days with
removal of 18L of fluid. Upon completion of ultrafiltration he
was diuresed unsuccessfully with lasix boluses. He was started
on a lasix drip with a goal of even to negative fluid balance.
However, we were limited given his hypotension and had to be
held frequently. His blood pressure also did not tolerate
nesiritide. Captopril was added at a dose of 12.5 mg TID for
afterload reduction, along with Lasix drip as tolerated by BP.
Digoxin was also added for inotropic effect. Close to discharge,
the patient was tolerating captopril plus intermittent lasix
drip of 2mg/hr titrated to blood pressure. The lasix drip was
converted to a standing dose of 40mg IV BID. Metolazone 5mg po
BID was also added for synergy.  Pt did well on this regimen x
48hrs prior to the time of discharge. Pt was initially informed
that he may be candidate for MV replacement surgery, but was
subsequently refused this surgery by the CT [**Doctor First Name **] service who
felt that his operative risk was too high given his significant
comorbities.

4 History of endocarditis ([**2127**]'s): TEE showed a question of a
vegetation on MV. Subsequently, low suspicion.

5. Agitation: Pt was kept on a standing dose of haldol 2.5 mg
TID which was effective.

7. Nutrition: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a PEG tube and was tolerating tube
feeds using Respalor Full strength at 50cc/hr.  Vit C and Zinc
were added per nutrition recommendations.

8. Endocrine: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has known panhypopituitarism. He was
admitted on prednisone 5 mg daily (home dose). He required
stress dose steroids for his adrenal, subsequently tapered to 20
mg PO daily, on which he remains at the time of discharge.

Regarding his diabetes, serum glucose was well controlled on an
insulin sliding scale starting with 5 units for FSG > 150 and
incrementing by 2 units.

9. Hematology: He had thrombocytopenia initially on admission.
HIT antibody was negative. His thrombocytopenia was subsequently
attributed to Linezolid, and resolved several days after
linezolid was discontinued. Platelet count 170s on day of
discharge.

10. Prophylaxis: Pt was treated with Carafate for GI prophylaxis
(given thrombocytopenia) and Heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis.

11. Physical Therapy: Pt was felt to be progressing well from a
PT standpoint. He will need continued aggressive PT follow-up.

12. Access: A right subclavian was placed on [**2162-11-14**] and a PICC
line was placed on [**2162-11-30**].
