The patient is a 55 y/o woman with metastatic adenocarcinoma of
unknown primary (likely discrete gastric or pancreaticobiliary
ca) admitted with tachycardia in the setting of malignant
pericardial effusions and uncontrolled pain.
.
# Malignant Effusion - The patient presented for outpatient
therapeutic thoracocentesis [**7-12**] (done for worsening SOB) with
removal of 2200 mL R sided fluid, followed by excruciating pain
at thoracotomy site. The dyspnea after her procedure was likely
a result of reexpansion edema, which was reflected on her chest
X-ray. She was initially treated in the intensive care unit with
oxygen therapy as well as IV Lasix and closely monitored. No
infectious etiology was identified. It was decided that
thoracentesis was not warranted as her pleural effusion was
significantly smaller after the procedure. Her respiratory
distress rapidly improved with diuresis and she was soon back to
baseline (requires home O2).
.
# Mucinous adenocarcinoma of unknown primary: The patient began
chemotherapy on [**2181-6-15**] with Gemzar and CPT-11 for metastatic
disease. She did not experience significant nausea during
hospitalization, but continued to have diarrhea related to her
chemotherapy which was treated with Lomotil.
.
# DVT/PE - She is s/p IVC filter placement on [**2181-5-30**] s/p DVT of
common femoral. She was continued on lovenox therapy.
.
# Pain - Patient had known lytic lesions, with high risk of
pathologic fracture. Bilateral hip xray on [**6-12**] demonstrated no
progression of known metastatic lesions. Orthopedics were
consulted on prior admisson and believe chemotherapy should
proceed prior to any radiation therapy to the hip. Also with
pain at site of thoracentesis. She was treated with home
fentanyl 25mcg patch for pain control, home lidocaine patch with
morphine for breakthrough pain
