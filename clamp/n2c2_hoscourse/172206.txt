A/P: 70 y.o. woman with a history of metastatic ovarian CA
presenting with chest pain, found to have large pulmonary
embolus with significant DVT clot burden, hemodynamically
stable, saturating well on RA, now on lovenox.
.
# PE with large DVT clot burden. The patient presented with
chest pain and was found on CT scan to have a large saddle
embolus with near complete occlusion of the RLL pulmonary artery
and a likely infarct of the RLL. CT scan also revealed left
common femoral vein DVT and Left gonadal vein thrombus. It is
likely that these clots occurred secondary to hypercoaguability
of malignancy. The patient was hemodynamically stable. EKG
showed sinus tachycardia without clear signs of Right heart
strain. The patient was initiated on IV heparin and briefly sent
to the ICU out of concern for her considerable clot burden and
potential hemodynamic complications. The patient had a fever,
likely secondary to her clot burden. The patient was changed to
lovenox for long-term anticoagulation. She remained
hemodynamically stable throughout her admission, saturating well
(>95%) on RA and with improved chest pain. Lower extremity
ultrasound was ordered to further assess clot burden. However,
the ultrasound tech was not available to complete the study and
after discussion with radiology it was felt that the CT scan
provided adequate imaging of the deep veins. There was no change
of management to be made based upon the Lower extremity
ultrasound study. The patient will likely require life-long
lovenox vs. coumadin therapy.
.
# Anemia. On admission, the patient's Hct dropped from 34.4 to a
nadir of 26.4 in the setting of new anticoagulation. The patient
had no obvious source of bleeding. The patient's Hct stabilized
and trended upward prior to discharge.
.
# Ovarian CA. Intravenous and intraperitoneal chemotherapy per
primary oncologist.
.
# HTN. Well controlled on CCB and diuretic.
.
# Leukopenia. Likely secondary to chemotherapy. Not neutropenic
by numbers.
.
# Fever. Resolved. Likely secondary to clot burden. Cultures
without growth to date.
.
# Hyperlipidemia. The patient's statin therapy was held while
LFT's were elevated, likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.
This therapy was re-instated prior to discharge as her LFT's
normalized.
