86F with a PMH of seizure disorder (GTC in [**9-/2159**], none since)
on Keppra, likely secondary to hemorrhagic left frontal IPH in
[**2154**], symptomatic bradycardia and syncope s/p PPM, dementia,
chronic C. difficile, HTN, HLD, who was initially admitted to
the medicine service for shaking episodes in the context of a
UTI. On the floor patient had several focal motor seizures
involving right leg>arm jerking and neurology was consulted. CT
head showed no new changes and Keppra was increased. EEG showed
frequent focal motor seizures with Cz-Fz and left frontal
epileptiform discharges. She then began to have secondarily
generalized events, and due to her uncontrolled seizures despite
increased Keppra and 3 doses of IV lorazepam 0.5mg patient was
transferred to the neuro ICU service overnight from [**Date range (1) 26246**].

# Neuro:
She was connected to EEG monitoring, which initially showed
frequent focal seizures originating in the L frontoparietal
region Q15 minutes. She was loaded with Fosphenytoin 1300mg and
started on 100mg IV Q8hrs. Her seizure activity initially
resolved but subsequently recurred in the afternoon of [**5-15**], and
she was loaded with an additional 500mg IV Keppra and started on
1500mg IV BID.

Seizures were thought to be related to her prior IPH in the
setting of a reduced seizure threshold due to her UTI. However
the seizure focus on EEG appeared to be separated from the
location of her IPH. As she could not undergo MRI, a CT with
contrast was performed to investigate for an new underlying
lesion. The patient was started on lacozamide but it was
discotinued as she developed severe drug reaction.
We increased keppra to [**2147**] mg [**Hospital1 **] and added gabapentin 300 mg
to her meds .

#Drug reaction: she developed generalized erythematous rash all
over her body and elevated liver enzyme , started on topical and
systemic steroid:75 mg solumedrol, after LFT improved and rash
vanished we d/c topical steroid and taper solumedrole dose with
change to po prednisone, we will taper it down in 6 weeks with
checking LFT every week till they become normal.
# CV:
She was maintained on telemetry monitoring with no significant
events.

# Resp:
Her respiratory status remained stable. CXR was clear with no
evidence of pneumonia.

# ID:
She remained afebrile during her ICU stay. She was continued on
ceftriaxone for treatment of her UTI until her sensitivities
returned. She was switched to nitrofurantoin based on the
sensitivity data. the result came back positive for pseudomona
as colonization, we stoped antibiotic. he was continued on oral
vancomycin for chronic c.diff colitis

# FEN:
She was initially maintained NPO given her depressed mental
status. As she became more alert she was seen by speech and
swallow and was cleared for a regular diet with ground solids
and thin liquids.
***************
She was transferred to the neurology floor on [**2160-5-16**].
.
[] Seizures - She was started on Lacosamide to help further
control her seizures. An ECG was checked for PR interval
monitoring. Her right sided weakness continued to improve.
.
[] UTI - She was treated with Nitrofurantoin for a total of 7
days for her UTI.
.
PENDING STUDIES: final EEG reports
.
TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES:
[ ] Please f/u her seizure frequency and side effects on her new
anticonvulsant regimen.
