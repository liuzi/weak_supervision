65 year old male with squamous cell CA of tongue, with recurrent
disease and evidence of metastases and recent spread to spine
who presented with worsnening dyspnea on exertion and weight
loss.

The patient's chief reason for presenting to the ICU was
multifactorial hypoxia due to his COPD, CHF, pleural effusion
and probable aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.  On presentation
he was started on levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia.
Nevertheless he continued to have worsening of his dyspnea and
sputum production and during the day of [**2156-1-11**] he was noted to
be increasingly hypoxic and his oxygen saturations were dropping
to the 80's on 6L NC.  He was switched to 100% NRB and
maintained sats in the 90's on that but appeared to be tiring
and was transferred to the ICU on [**2156-1-11**].  At that point a blood
gas revealed profound respiratory acidosis and he was then
intubated for ventilatory failure.  The patient has treated with
vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole for aspiration/HAP and was
gently diuresed.  No microbiologic diagnosis of the patient's
pneumonia was ever made and despite BAL no organisms were ever
isolated.  On [**2156-1-13**] a thoracentesis was performed to evaluate
for complicated effusion and this showed sterile inflammatory
fluid consistent with parapneumonic effusion.  The patient did
improve somewhat allowing some weaning of ventilatory settings
and acutally self extubated on [**2156-1-14**].  Unfortunately, after
extubation mental status remained poor and the patient became
progressively more hypercarbic requiring reintubation on [**2156-1-15**].
 On the morning of [**2156-1-16**] NIF was checked and was less than 30
suggesting generalized muscle weakness and high likelihood of
ventilatory failure if extubated.  With this information, and
given the patient had been reluctant to undergo chemotherapy in
the first place and had expressed a desire to not be permanently
sustained on artificial means, his husband and family decided to
terminally extubate the patient and make him comfortable.  He
was extubated on the evening of [**2156-1-16**] and gradually became more
hypoxic before expiring of respiratory failure.  His husband
declined autopsy.
