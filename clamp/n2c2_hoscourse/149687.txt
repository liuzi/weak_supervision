  The patient was seen in the Emergency
Department where he was subsequently intubated and
transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  The patient
was immediately placed on a lasix drip for aggressive
diuresis.  Given his elevated creatinine level, his
cyclosporin was held.  The patient was also treated for
hyperkalemia with Kayexalate, insulin, and dextrose.  An
echocardiogram was done which demonstrated, again, an
ejection fraction of 35% without changes from prior study.

On hospital day #3, the patient was weaned from his lasix
drip and was started on intravenous lasix [**Hospital1 **].  His skin
staples were removed at this time, as well.  A central venous
line was placed for poor access into the left subclavian vein
on hospital day #3.  On hospital day #5, the patient was
extubated.  At this time, he was approximately 25 liters
negative.

He was subsequently transferred to the floor on hospital day
#6.  He was seen by the physical therapy service to assist
with ambulation and activity.  His Foley catheter was removed
at this time, and his transplant medications were resumed.
The patient's total bilirubin had been elevated throughout
his stay, and a liver ultrasound with biopsy was performed on
hospital day #7.  This study demonstrated questionable
stenosis of the right hepatic artery and was negative for
ejection.  The patient continued to be diuresed, was advanced
to a regular diet, and was receiving physical therapy
treatment until the time of discharge on hospital day #10.
He will be discharged to the [**Hospital6 310**]
for physical therapy and intravenous lasix diuresis.  He will
be discharged with the left subclavian central venous line
until better access is obtained.
