68yoM with history of CAD s/p IMI in [**2185**] with BMS to RCA and
BPH presenting with dizziness/LH and low Hct, found to have GI
Bleed with antral ulcers.

# GI Bleed: The patient presented with melena, with low Hct and
orthostasis. The patient had a history of active NSAID use, and
also uses Etoh socially. He was admitted to the MICU. He got 2
units PRBCs without Hct response to the first unit, but with
good Hct response to the second unit. EGD showed non-bleeding
antral ulcers and possible Barretts esophanus. The patient was
stable with no further Hct drop, so he was transfered to the
floor.  He was counseled to avoid all NSAIDs indefinently,
unless told otherwise by GI in the future. GI saw the patient in
house and will follow outpatient, with repeat EGD in [**6-18**] weeks
to eval for healing of antral ulcers and possible esophagus
biopsy. H pylori blood test was sent and was pending at time of
discharge.

# CAD: s/p BMS placement in [**2185**]. No active signs of ischemia
now, Troponins negative, EKG unchanged, no chest pain. Dizziness
and diaphoresis likely [**2-11**] anemia from acute blood loss from GI
bleed, and does not represent anginal equivalent at this time.
ASA 325 was initially held on admission for acute GI bleed. On
discussion with outpatient cardiologist, it was decided to
decrease ASA to 81 daily. ASA was restarted the morning of
discharge since it was felt that the patient was not actively
bleeding.
