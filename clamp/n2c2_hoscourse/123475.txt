The patient was brought emergently to the Operating Room on
[**2163-5-27**] for type A dissection, after initial assessment he
underwent emergent Ascending aortic/hemi-arch aorta replacement
with 30-mm Gelweave graft and resuspension of the aortic valve.
His HYPOTHERMIC CIRCULATORY ARREST TIME was 19 minutes,
cardiopulmonary bypass TIME was 131 minutes, and a CROSS-CLAMP
TIME of 76 minutes. He tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. He was supported
with pressors in the immediate post-op period, initial attempts
to wake and wean from ventilator failed due to hypoxia, his
post-op CXR was wet and he required additional diuresis prior to
extubation. during subsequent attempts to wean from ventilator
he developed atrial fibrillation, he converted to sinus rhythm
with amiodarone and Bblockers.  He was extubated on POD 3, after
which he experienced post-op delerium, which improved with
Haldol and  discontinuation of narcotics. He had cleared by the
following day and transferred from ICU to stepdown floor.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD eight the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing, pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location 1268**] in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
