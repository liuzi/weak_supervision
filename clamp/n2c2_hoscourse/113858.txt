This is a 78 year old male with history of paradoxical atrial
fibrillation, pulmonary asbestosis, and idiopathic RP fibrosis
presenting with cellulitis and increased abdominal distension
found to have DVT and with progressive chylous ascites.

1)Chylous Ascites: The patient was noted to have a distended
abdomen on presentation and imaging revealed a large amount of
ascites.  As the patient had not had a previous history of
ascites this was worked up with liver ultrasound that revealed
no parenchymal or vascular dysfunction.  Diagnostic paracentesis
was obtained on [**2196-11-5**] that showed chylous ascites.  This
paracentesis also revealed >250 neutrophils so the patient was
empirically started on a five day course of ceftriaxone though
he remained afebrile and had no abdominal pain.  After the
chylous ascites was discovered primary concern was for a
malignancy given the lack of liver disease.  Multiple imaging
studies failed to show a mass,  however, multiple fluid
cytologies were negative, and the patient's LDH was within
normal limits making lymphoma quite unlikely.  Therefore, most
likely etiology of the development of chylous ascites was
thought to be progressive lymphatic obstruction from RP fibrosis
leading to increased hydrostatic pressure and leak into the
peritoneal cavity.  The patient had three therapeutic
paracentesis on [**11-14**], and [**11-29**] respectively removing 900
cc, 3L and 1 L of chylous fluid respectively.  The second of
these revealed a neutrophil count of 280 so led to a second
course of five days of antibiotics with ciprofloxacin (as the
patient was on cefepime/vanc when the paracentesis occured)
which completed on [**2196-11-29**].  All cultures remained negative.
Unfortunately, the patient developed secondary chylothorax from
fluid tracking up into the pleural space causing respiratory
distress.  Attempts were made to slow accumulation of fluid with
medical therapies including octreotide and low fat diet then low
fat TPN but these were unsuccessful.  General surgery was
consulted twice and both times said that surgery to attempt to
improve lymph drainage would be unsuccessful as structures are
very small and diffuse and post-surgical scarring would likely
be as damaging as initial insult.  Case was discussed with
thoracic surgery who thought that without clear damage to
thoracic duct there was no indication for procedural management.
 Finally, the possibility of lymphangiogram was discussed
extensively with a possible intervention and balloon dilation of
cisterna chyli.  Unfortunately, planning MRI would have been
required and given patient's progressively poor respiratory
status this would have required intubation.  As lymphangiogram
and balloon dilation are extremely uncommon procedures, odds of
success were not considered high and risk of intubation and
likely difficulty extubation was discussed with the family and
patient and they elected to pursue comfort focused care.  The
possibility of disease modifying therapy for RP fibrosis was
discussed with rheumatology, but they said there would be no
role for the agents used (almost all of which are immune
suppressants) in this acutely sick individual and these things
would be unlikely to lead to quick turn-around.

2) Chylothorax/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was
initially noted to be hypoxic soon after admission with desats
to the low 90's on room air.  He was seen by pulmonary who
attributed this to ascites and his large abdomen causing
restrictive pathology in the setting of his underlying pulmonary
asbestosis and plaques.  This was supported by his initial PFT's
that showed a restrictive pattern.  The patient then became
progressively more hypoxic in the setting of an expanding right
sided pleural effusion and a large amount of compressive
atelectasis.  He was desatting to the low 90's on 4L O2 by nasal
cannula when he had his first thoracentesis on [**2196-11-10**] with
considerable improvement after the procedure.  By [**11-12**], however,
he had reaccumulated almost completely and by [**11-13**] was
desaturating again so that an ABG showed of O2 of around 53.
Therefore, he was transferred to the unit while he awaited a
second thoracentesis.  As he reaccumulated quickly again after
that thoracentesis decision was made to place a pigtail
catheter, which was placed on [**2196-11-15**].  Over the ensuing days
the patient continued to put out greater than one liter of
chylous fluid per 24 hour period despite the various
interventions meant to reduce chylous ascites mentioned (low fat
diets, octreotide, etc...).  On [**2196-11-29**] a pleurodesis was
attempted in hopes of allowing eventual removal of the chest
tube though interventional pulmonology thought this had a very
low probability of being successful.  After the second
thoracentesis the patient remained dependent on at least 4L of
oxygen by nasal cannula to keep sats> 90%.  On [**11-26**] he
desaturated to the 80's on 6L in the context of worsening
infiltrates bilaterally but this seemed to improve with holding
TPN and was ultimately thought most likely due to volume
overload. However, on the day of expected discharge ([**11-30**]), his
respiratory status worsened (oxygen saturation of 90-92% on
non-rebreather) and he did not wish to use the mask. Given that
comfort was the goal, he was transitioned back to nasal cannula,
and oxygen saturations were no longer followed.

3) Nutrition/Protein Loss: Initially the patient was allowed to
eat a regular diet but in attempts at medical management he was
converted to a low fat, high protein diet and then made NPO with
TPN. Despite TPN his protein and albumin continued to fall
presumably due to losses in the chest tube.   After he became
quite volume overloaded on [**2196-11-27**] and given the minimal
reduction in fluid output seen even with the TPN modifications
TPN was stopped as of [**11-27**] and he was allowed to eat for
comfort.  He and his family understand he will ultimately
continue to become malnourished and weaker but given poor
toleration of TPN and comfort focused care this was considered
acceptable by them.

4) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient was noted to
have intermittently elevated white counts and on [**2196-11-19**] had a
right upper lobe infiltrate on chest radiograph and had purulent
sputum.  Therefore, he received 9 days of cefepime/vancomycin
with some improvement in his sputum production and stable chest
radiograph findings.  White count failed to trend reliably. He
was never febrile.

5) LLE DVT: He was initially on heparin gtt then transitioned to
be therapeutic on coumadin.  He was transferred back to heparin
gtt once on the medical service and continued on this throughout
his course there to make procedures feasible without needing a
long warfarin wash-out. Anticoagulation with medications other
than unfractionated heparin (enoxaparin, warfarin) was not
optimal given his renal failure and poor nutritional status.

6)Cellulitis: The patient initially received a dose of
penicillin then a few days of cefazolin with minimal improvement
in his abdominal rash.  He then received 10 days of vancomycin
as well as steroid cream after dermatology thought the abdominal
rash could be a contact dermatitis.  This led to resolution of
his abdominal rash.

7) Likely drug rash: Later in his hospitalization (around
[**11-19**]-15th) he developed a morbilliform eruption on his
trunk in the context of receiving a dose of
piperacillin-tazobactam in the ICU.  This medication was stopped
an his rash resolved.

8) Hypotension: The patient developed relative hypotension in
the hospital.  Multiple blood cultures were negative and this
seemed stable without mental status changes or end organ
dysfunction (except some worsening of his CKD).  This was
thought likely due to poor cardiac return due to massive third
spacing from his protein losses and perhaps external compression
of the IVC by his abdomen.

9) Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline Cr is unclear.
At presentation Cr was 2 then trended down to 1.5 before
trending up again in the setting of worsening ascites and his
general deterioration.  Renal was consulted twice and ultimately
concluded this was likely due to poor preload and forward flow
from the heart in the context of his third spacing and massive
abdominal distension.  He never became oliguric or anuric.

10) Atrial fibrillation: The patient developed atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response while his nodal
agents were being held.  This broke with diltiazem and he was
restarted on this medication with good rate control.

11) Goals of Care: After extensive discussion with the family
and patient about the lack of options for reversing the
patient's chylous ascites accumulation and subsequent
respiratory compromise and progressive protein wasting they
elected to pursue comfort focused care.  Reasonably benign
interventions (i.e. antibiotics, pleurodesis through a
preexisting chest tube) were pursued but other aggressive cares
were not.  Similarly oral feeds were pursued even in the face of
a possible SBO for the patient's comfort and happiness.  His
major goal was comfort and the family and patient understood his
poor prognosis. When his respiratory status deteriorated on
[**11-30**] (as above), further diagnostics and interventions were not
pursued, and he was given morphine. He passed away in the
evening of [**11-30**], and his family was notified. Autopsy was
requested and will be performed at [**Hospital1 18**].
