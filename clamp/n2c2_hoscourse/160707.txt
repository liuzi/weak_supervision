66 year old M with transfusion dependent MDS, D+7 s/p allo SCT,
normal pressure hydrocephalus, CAD, HTN and diabetes, who was
initially electively admitted for allo SCT with clofarabine,
total nodal radiation and anti-thymoglobulin. His course was
complicated by febrile neutropenia and renal failure.

His creatinine was 1.1 on admission and rose to > 5 following
administration of clofarabine per SCT protocol. He developed
metabolic acidosis and worsening confusion over the course of
several days leading up to his transplant. On SCT day +1, he was
febrile and started on vancomycin and cefepime. On SCT day +3,
he was transferred to ICU for worsening mental status, increased
respiratory distress, and renal failure. He remained febrile and
was seen by the ID consult team and transitioned to meropenem +
levofloxacin + voriconazole. He was intubated electively for
multiple procedures including MRI, VP shunt tap (by
neurosurgery), and bronchoscopy and extubated the following day.
He was started on ambisome in place of voriconazole for positive
galactomannan on BAL (presumed aspergillosis pneumonia). He was
seen by the neprhology team and started on HD for presumed
clofarabine toxicity. Mental status improved and he was called
out to the BMT service.

However, two days later he was at dialysis when he developed an
episode of altered mental status associated with tachycardia,
hypertension and hypoxia to 88% on 2L NC. His respiratory status
continued to decline and he was reintubated and transferred to
the ICU. In addition, he became hypotensive requiring pressors
for a few hours; pressors were eventually weaned off, although
he then developed shock liver and probable DIC requiring
multiple transfusions. Due to electrolyte derangements CVVH was
started as well.  His abx were broadened to double cover
aspergillus (posaconazole+ambisome), vanc was changed to dapto
for VRE coverage, bactrim was added for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 21150**].

At approximately 3:12 AM on [**2165-6-24**], housestaff were called to
evaluate the patient after his nurse noticed his A-line pressure
[**Location (un) 1131**] dropped abruptly to SBP in the 10s-20s. On evaluation,
he was unresponsive and did not have palpable pulses. At that
time, back board was placed beneath patient and CPR was
initiated. Pulseless electrical activity was noted on the
monitor at interval 2-minute pulse checks (no shockable rhythm).
He received epinephrine 1 mg IV x 2 doses at five minutes apart.
 Housestaff notified the patient's wife, who requested that the
resuscitation be stopped. At this time, CPR was stopped and he
did not receive further vasopressors.  He did not regain a
pulse. The monitor continued to show pulseless electrical
activity for several minutes with slowing heart rate until
asystole. At that time, the patient was examined and was noted
to have no audible breath or heart sounds. His pupils were fixed
and dilated to ~5mm. There were not signs of life evident. The
time of death was noted to be 3:23 AM.  Attending physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name (STitle) **] was notified of the above events. The patient's wife was
then contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding an autopsy and agreed to autopsy.
