# HLH:
Clinical scenario consistent with HLH.  Pt was admitted with
severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. He has had 4 days of ATG,
which was stopped early due to neutropenia - he later received
the 5th dose when neutropenia resolved. Pt was also placed on
high dose IV steriods, initially solumedrol 120mg [**Hospital1 **] that were
ultimately tapered to prednisone 40mg [**Hospital1 **] by beginning of [**Month (only) 205**].
Only possible cause of HLH that could be identified was ? of CMV
infection with two different viral load tests showing positive
viral load. Pt ended up getting two bone marrow biopsies ([**7-9**]
and [**8-14**]) which both showed evidence of some hemophagycytosis.
The liver biopsy on [**8-8**] showed no evidence of malignancy,
necrosis, or infections. The pathology present was predominantly
cholestatic and most consistent with drug induced changes. Pt
was held off other chemotherapeutic regimens for the first 6
weeks of the hospitalization because of his combined renal
failure and liver cholestasis. Once pt recovered renal function
and was declared by nephrology to no longer required
hemodialysis, he was started on low dose cyclosporine 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
on the evening of [**8-23**]. Initial trough value was very low (<30)
two days later.  His cyclosporine was gradually increased in
dose with the most recent dose being 175mg po BID. Cyclosporine
goal trough is 150-200 and should next be checked on [**2192-9-2**] and
should be checked every 48 hrs.  Lab results should be faxed
every 48 hrs as soon as test results come back to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 638**] and to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 85488**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 85489**].  Along with these
you can fax CBC and chem 10 pls obtain as detailed on order
sheet. Pt started on standing magnesium given cyclosporine
results in magnesium wasting. Pt is also on predisone 40mg [**Hospital1 **].

Throughout admission pt continued to show evidence of red cell
and plt destruction on laboratory data (hgb/plts would drift
down, haptoglobin low, retics high). Initially numerous PRBC and
platelet transfusions were needed to stabilize pt while in the
ICU. Once he recovered enough to be on the floor, pt was
intermittently given PRBCs when his Hct was low enough that
there was concern for it causing symptoms. He only received plts
on the floor one time per IR before they pulled out the HD
catheter. He was followed closely by hematology while in the
hospital who recommend the following treatment for his HLH:

Unfortunately with HLH the patient's prognosis over the next
year is very poor.

# Sepsis/DIC: Mr. [**Known lastname 74316**] presented with hypotension, elevated
WBC, elevated lactate, decreased haptoglobin, elevated PT/PTT,
and elevated fibrinogen. No clear infectious source, possible
liver or lung. Upon presentation pt was treated empirically with
meropenem, levofloxacin from HAP with GN coverage since pt had
been hospitalized and was on immunosuppression. He ultimately
completed a 14 day course of meropenem. Culture data was
ultimately all negative with the only positive micro test being
a low CMV VL. ID started pt on Gancyclovir for ppx, and initial
Acyclovir was stopped. Pt then suffered from neutropenia thought
possible related to Gancyclovir vs ATG. Repeat CMV VLs were
negative and Gancyclovir was stopped. Histo was negative so also
okay to stop Ambisome. Pt had been on bactrim as an outpatient
for PCP prophylaxis while on steroids, but this was changed to
atovaquone due patients liver injury and concerns for bactrim
involvement. Later in hospital course, pt was restarted on
acyclovir for prophylaxis while on the steroids. Repeat CMV VL
from [**2192-8-22**] was positive for 1,630 copies and he was restarted
on Valganciclovir 900 mg PO BID with a plan for 3 weeks of
treatment total after discharge. His CBC will need to be
monitored daily to look for neutropenia, but has remained stable
after 4 days of treatment.

# Respiratory failure: Electively intubated on [**7-30**] and
extubated on [**8-3**].  Post extubation maintained oxygen sats on
nasal cannula and then on room air. Throughout admission pt
continued to have cough, occasionally productive, and somewhat
congested chest, but no evidence of infection was found and pt
was not treated with Abx for PNA after initial presentation. Pt
has hx of asthma and was previously on Advair. So neb tx and
advair were given throughout hospitalization. Pt had CT of chest
for f/u of new poorly well-defined round opacities and right mid
and left lower lung, concerning for infection such as septic
emboli or fungal. CT scans shows areas of opacity overall
improving when compared to prior image in [**Month (only) 116**]. As per above, ID
added Atovaquone for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] given that Bactrim can cause BM
suppression and liver damage.

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Pt developed A-fib on [**8-1**] which
then resolved on [**8-4**]. This was likely related infection and
respiratory distress. He was started on metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **], he
converted to sinus. Currently NSR. Metoprolol 25mg PO BID was
continued throughout admission although pt did not have any more
incidences of documented afib while on hospital.

# Elevated LFTs: Uncertain about etiology initially, but after
liver bx results were final the leading likelyhood is
cholestatic drug induced liver injury [**3-20**] to bactrim. Overall
improvement in LFT??????s, but t.bili was significantly elevated (38
at one point). Tbili slowly came down over course of the next
month although ALT and Alk phos remained stably somewhat
elevated. The LFT improvement that was noted initially dis seem
to correlate with ATG treatment.

# Anemia: Hemolyzing. Schistocytes previously seen on smear.
Hemophagocytosis seen in BM. Pt was intermittently transfused as
noted above when Hct would get around 21 or when there was
concern that pt was getting symptomatic from his anemia. Epogen
was given with HD while pt was on dialysis. Once dialysis was
discontinued, it was given MWF (4k units). As pt clinically
stabilized, he was kept in the hospital by the concern that he
continued to show evidence of red cell destruction.

# Thrombocytopenia: Pt required plt transfusions in the ICU as
initially his plts were low and somewhat labile. He was also
transfused for liver biopsy. Once the patient was stable enough
for the floor his plts ranged from 20k-80k. On the floor he was
transfused plts once when IR took out the HD cath, but otherwise
his transfusion parameter was set at spontaneous bleeding. The
exact etiology of the low plts was never completely clear but it
is likely multifactorial and related to HLH, medications, and
overall health.

# Neutropenia: Pt became neutropnic after 4 doses of ATG and 2
doses of Gancyclovir which may have caused BM suppression.
Counts quickly resolving after stopping offending meds. Once
count improved pt was given last dose of ATG. Gancyclovir was
kept off until [**8-24**] when a repeat CMV viral load was again
suddenly positive. Low dose gancyclovir was restarted and WBC
counts should be monitored daily.  Pt was then swtiched to
Galvancyclovir as per ID and his WBC have been monitored and
have been stable.  Will monitor his WBC while in [**Hospital 3782**] rehab to
watch for recurrence of the neutropenia

# Coagulopathy: Related to liver disease, infection, HLH. Pt did
not need FFP. Pt was given vit K x 3 days early in admission.
INR was stable around 1 for most of admission.

# Renal failure: Received CVVHx 3 days. This was stopped on
[**8-2**]. He then had microfiltration on the same day to help with
diureses for extubation.  He was started on HD [**8-4**]. Stayed on
HD until [**8-18**] with slow improvement of kidney function. After HD
was stopped, Cr was observed for a few days and when it
continued to show improvement down below 2, and pt continued to
make very good urine output, his HD line was pulled by IR on
[**8-23**]. Renal followed throughout course of disease and helped
manage electrolytes and guide HD therapy.

#Hyponatremia: Mr. [**Known lastname 74316**] developed hyponatremia on [**2192-8-28**]
when he was autodiuresis after his kidney recovered from his
ARF. His hyponatremia and autodiuresis is likely also related to
poor glc control. He made up to 6.5L of urine 3 days prior to
discharge. PLEASE FLUID RESTRICT TO 2.5L daily as his sodium
improved with free water fluid restriction.

# Hypertension: Pt had elevated BP that was worse with ATG
infusion. He initially required Nitro drip for better BP
control. This was discontinued quickly once control was achieved
and he was restarted on his home dose of amlodipine 7.5mg which
was then increased dose to 10mg Qday. HD also helped with BP
control. Some additional control was provided by the metoprolol
on which the patient was kept to control Afib.

#Hyperglycemia: Pt not a diabetic, but glucose was elevated in
the setting of high dose steroids and tube feeds. Managed with
NPH of varying AM and PM doses with humalog ISS. Once tube feeds
were stopped and oral intake restarted he again had to adjust
NPH and ISS to keep sugars in an acceptable range. He is being
discharged on NPH and an ISS.

# Delerium: After patient was transferred to the floor from the
ICU he developed delirium over the first weekend which
manifested as inappropriate and sometimes violent actions with
pt attempting to hit staff and spitting on staff. Pt had to be
restrained with leather restraints for parts of two days because
he was able to break out of the soft restraints despite his
deconditioning. The first night this occurred pt had to be given
haloperidol and ativan. Psych was then involved in care and
recommended giving quitiapene QHs with extra prn doses as
needed. Pt was on this regimen, with slow tapering of the QHs
dose for the next two weeks, although delirium never again was
an issue. Pt was intermittently mildly depressed about his body
weakness and how long he had been in the hospital.
.
# Lung nodule: New poorly well-defined round opacities and right
mid and left lower lung, concerning for infection such as septic
emboli or fungal organisms. Chest CT  showed areas of opacity
overall improving when compared to prior image in [**Month (only) 116**] (when he
was previously admitted for what was thought to be TTP). This
was thought to be related to prior pulmonary hemorrhage that is
now resolving. Nodule will need follow-up as an outpatient after
discharge.

# HA: Early in admission, pt c/o bilateral frontal HA with no
focal neurological deficits found on exam, however this was a
new finding and given low platelet count this was concerning for
head bleed. Head CT showed no IC bleeding or other acute
process. HA resolved over next few days and was not an issue for
the rest of admission.

# Chest pain: pt had two episodes of epigastric pain which
raised concerns for chest pain. At each time EKGs were
unremarkable and cardiac enzymes did not show evidence of acute
MI (although troponin was stably elevated in context of renal
failure). Pt described pain as not unlike the GERD pain he
occasionally had in the past, and both times pain seemed to
resolve with a GI cocktail.

# Insomnia: He had difficulty with sleeping during his hospital
course and was started on trazodone qhs with good effect.
