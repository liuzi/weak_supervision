# Finger infection: Concerned initially for deep tissue
infection, however I+D without pus x 2 in the ED. On admission
the x-ray wet read osteomyelitis was a possiblility. Hand
surgery was consulting on the patient and the patient was placed
on vancomycin and ceftazidime with HD. The antibiotitcs were
started on [**2182-5-24**] and will finish on [**2182-7-5**]. Blood cultures
eventually grew multiple strains of bacteria including CONS and
GNRs with high levels of resistence. ID was consulted and
recommended vanc/meropenem for at least a 6 week course but they
will tailor the antibiotics to her clinical status. She will
need weekly safety labs while on the antibiotics. These will
include cbc, chem 7 and lfts. These will be faxed to the [**Hospital 4898**]
clinic at [**Hospital1 18**]. A PICC line was placed on [**2182-6-2**] for meropenem
dosing. Hand surgery recommended [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes and [**Hospital1 **]
soaks in betadyne/saline solution (a 1:1 ratio). They will
follow up with the patient on the Tuesday after her discharge in
hand clinic. If her appointment needs to be rescheduled the
number is: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3009**]. It is very important that she follow up
with them as she may need an amputation of the finger if the
infection does not clear up with antibiotics. Her pain was
controlled with tylenol RTC. She was unable to tolerate
oxycodone or morphine as they made her sleepy.

# HTN: BP 201/60 in the setting of pain on admission. Chronic
hypertensive on multiple agents. EKG without ischemic changes.
Pt without chest pain, HA, vision changes, or abd pain
suggestive of hypertensive emergency. Blood pressures were
well-controlled after pain controlled on her home regimen.
.
# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Pt had acute altered mental
status while on the medicine floors. Pt was aphasic with right
sided weakness. CODE stroke was called, and pt had urgent CT
head that demonstrated no ICH. She was transferred to the MICU
for closer monitoring. Pt was evaluated by neuro, who thought
most likely toxic metabolic given fevers. Given fevers,
meningitis was considered; however, unable to perform LP given
body habitus. MRI head was done which showed was concerning for
possible MCA territory infarction but could also have been
artifact that was not seen on the prior CTA Head. She underwent
a repeat head CT which revealed no changes from the prior one.
She was started on ASA 325mg daily per neuro recs. Her EEG
revealed epileptiform waves on the right side consistent with
seizures. Neurology recommended starting keppra. She remained
stable and was transferred to the medical floor. On discharge
she was alert and oriented X 3.

# DM: continued home doses of NPH and HISS

# CAD/PVD: continued statin, BB, imdur, ASA 81mg

# ESRD on HD MWF:  continued her regular dialysis sessions here
and continued renal caps and calcium accetate.

# Anemia: Patient's hematocrit down-trended while hospitalized.
Her hematocrit at discharge was 26.5.

# thrombocytopenia: at baseline.  Defer to outpatient providers
for followup.
# CODE: confirmed full with pt.

# Transitions of care:
- Patient will need weekly labs drawn in HD and faxed to the
[**Hospital 4898**] clinic to ensure she does not have toxicity from the
vancomycin
- Patient will need to follow up with hand clinic to ascertain
whether she needs an amputation 7-10days after discharge
- Patient has a PICC line in place (placed [**2182-6-2**]) which will
need to be taken out when antibiotic course is completed
