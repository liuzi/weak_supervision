35 yo F with h/o spontaneous PTX, GBS, HIT induced PEs,
vent-associated pneumonia called out from the MICU [**10-1**].  Her
recent history is significant for 2 admissions to [**Hospital1 2025**]
([**Date range (1) 32318**]/05) for spontaenous left pneumothoraces.  On her first
admission, she had a left sided chest tube placed, a VATS, and
pleurodesis.  She tolerated this well and was discharged on PO
dilaudid for pain control.  She re-presented for her second
admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] with a recurrent pneumothorax, got a 2nd left
sided chest tube, and was again discharged on PO dilaudid.
After being dischraged from [**Hospital1 2025**] she presented the same day to
[**Hospital1 18**] complaining of diffuse weakness and body pain as well as
episodic numbness.  She was initially treated with pain control
with a morphine PCA per the pain service.  She continued to have
diffuse weakness, increasing anxiety and psychiatry was
initially consulted for ? conversion disorder.  On the evening
of [**9-9**] a code was called as she was unresponsibe with a poor
respiratory effort (HR 100, sBP 160, O2Sat 70% on RA --> 94% on
face mask).  An ABG revealed pH 6.86, pO2 168 pCOs 179).  She
was intubated and transferred to the MICU.

1st MICU course:
A neurology consult felt her elevated LP protein (112), diffuse
motor weakness, rapid time course, and rapid increase in her
peripheral WBC ([**8-8**]) were all consistent with GBS.  She was
started on plasmapheresis and received four sessions (fifth
session was not completed because pheresis line had to be pulled
due to positive HIT antibody).  She also developed ventilator
associated pneumonia for which she was treated with
vanco/levo/vanc for a 7 day course which was finished on [**9-17**].
She also developed heparin associated thrombocytopenia which
improved after d/cing all heparin products.  On [**9-18**], she had
increasing respiratory distress and increasing O2 requirements
and a CTA revealed pulmonary emboli found within all 3 segmental
branches of the RUL pulmonary artery.  Due to her positive HIT
antibody, she was started on argatroban and coumadin.  She was
switched to a trach mask on [**9-23**] and tolerated this and on [**9-25**]
was transferred to the floor.  The morning of [**9-26**] she developed
[**10-27**] stabbing, non-radiating, L sided chest pain.  Cardiac
enzymes were negative and a stat ECHO showed no WMA.  A CXR was
unremarkable but a CT scan showed a large L PTX and she was
transferred back to the MICU.

2nd MICU course:
Her INR was reversed and on [**9-30**] she had a mechanical
pleurodesis and LUL wedge resection.  No blebs were seen but
there was abnormal appearing lung tissue in the apex.  She was
transferred out of the MICU on [**10-1**].

1. Pneumothorax: unclear etiology of recurrent PTX.  Possibly
secondary to her stature.  alpha-1-antitrypsin was negative.
S/p L-sided wedge resection and pleurodesis on [**9-30**].  She had 2
chest tubes and one was removed [**10-6**], but [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] drain was left
in place.  The [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was removed on [**10-17**] after a
successful flamping trial.  She will follow up with CT surgery
in 1 week.

2. Pulmonary Embolism: She had a PE in all 3 branches of RUL
pulmonary artery on [**9-18**] CT scan.  Developed HIT with
plasmapheresis for GBS.  Restarted argatroban and coumadin [**10-1**]
following CT surgery.  She was initially on coumadin 2.5 mg PO
QHS and stable with an INR between [**2-21**].  Her INR started to
trend down, however, and her coumadin was adjusted to 3 mg PO
QHS.  Before discharge however, her INR started to trend up
slightly past 3, so she was discharged on 2.5 mg PO QHS.  Her
INR will be followed up by her PCP during her appointment later
this week.  He has been called regarding this.

3. Guillain-[**Location (un) **] Syndrome: She was s/p four cycles of
plasmapheresis (didn't get fifth cycle due to developing HIT).
Her tracheostomy was dwonsized on [**10-10**].  Trach was buttoned on
[**10-13**] and removed on [**10-14**].  On discharge, her stoma was almost
completely healed and well-granulated.  She will continue to
bandage it until completely healed (7-10 days from removal
date), and will cover it with cellophane for showering.  Her
strength returned over the course of her admission with daily
physical therapy.  On discharge, she was able to walk on her own
with a cane and to manage a couple flight of stairs.  She has a
follow-up appointment scheduled with neurology, and has the
phone number of interventional pulmonary should she have any
questions regarding her stoma.

4. Pain: Patient has pain secondary to her Guillain-[**Location (un) **] and
Pneumothorax.  Her PCA was discontinued once the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was
removed, and her pain was well controlled with a fentanyl patch
and oral morphine, which will be tapered as an outpatient.  She
will also continue neurontin 600 mg TID per neurology.  She was
not given oxycodone as she had a history of anaphylaxis to
percocet.

5. Anxiety: She has chronic anxiety which has been heightened by
recent course of events.  She was placed on her home dose of
standing ativan 0.5 mg PO Q6, and had several discussions with
social work and psychiatry nurses in-house.

6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia - L retrocardiac opacity that
has since rsesolved.  Sputhm from [**9-11**] with Haemophilus
B-lactamase negative.  She completed a 7 day course of Levo/Vanc
on [**9-17**].  She was afebrile with a normal WBC count on discharge.

7. Anemia - Her hematocrit was stable since her 2nd transfer out
of the MICU and her anemia was thought to be secondary to
frequent blood draws.  No evidence of an RP bleed by CT scan, no
evidence of hemolysis.  She was transfused with 2 units on [**10-8**].
 Her hematocrit had been stable for several days on discharge.

8. Abdominal pain - She developed intermittent abdominal pain
after her second transfer out of the MICU which required
placement of an NG tube with tube feeding.  Her abdominal pain
spontaneously improved to the point where the tube was removed
and she was tolerating a regular diet, and further improved once
she was told to take POs slowly and to avoid milk products.  She
was discharged tolerating a regular diet with no further
abdominal complaints.
