76 yo male with end stage sarcoidosis presenting with dyspnea.
.
# HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt presented to the ER with
increased shortness of breath over 24hrs, tachycardia, and
generalized fatigue. Similar prior presentations were felt to be
related to sarcoid flares. CXR showed end stage pulmonary
fibrosis but no other abnormalities. It was felt his sx likely
represented pneumonia in setting of severe underlying fibrotic
lung disease. Pt was unable to sustain high minute ventilatory
rate, evidenced by a rising pCO2 and thus required emergent
intubation shortly after arrival to ICU. The patient was treated
for presumed pneumonia with levofloxacin and meropenem given
leukocytosis and dyspnea. Infectious work-up including multiple
blood cultures and viral cultures were negative.  The patient
was not given steroids since it was felt that his sx were
related to an infectious process rather than a flair of his
sarcoid lung disease. The patient was made DNR after talking
with the son. IP consult was sought for trach placement given
the patient's inability to wean off the ventilator with
subsequent placement of tracheostomy and PEG on [**1-26**] and [**1-27**]
respectively. Pt tolerated trach mask well. He was transferred
to the floor on [**2-3**]. Later that afternoon he was noted to
desat into the 50's with increased work of breathing and was
requiring high levels of nursing care. He was transferred back
to the MICU where he again experienced agitation and increased
work of breathing. He was placed back on the vent on PS
overnight and tolerated this well and eventually was able to
transition to trach mask throughtout the day and night. Clinical
decompensation attributed to mucus plugging.

# CHRONIC ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION: Pt normotensive on admission
to ICU. His home medications of midodrine and fludricortisone
were continued while admitted.

# Agitation: The patient had issues with agitation especially at
night. Geriatrics was consulted and a regimen of Seroquel was
initiated as well as efforts to limit lines and to orient him
frequently. His mental status waxed and waned and he fell out of
bed twice but sustained no injuries. By [**2-1**] his delirium had
improved on a regimen of seroquel to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], seroquel 25 mg
QHS and Seroquel 25mg prn. Upon readmission to the MICU,
however, he again became significantly agitated and required IV
haldol in addition to his scheduled seroquel. EKG the following
morning did not show any eveidence of prolonged QT.  Per
geriatric recommendations the pt's seroquel was increased to
50mg qhs and his sundowning improved. QTc was noted to 419 on
discharge dose of seroquel.
.
The patient was on SubQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis and PPI for
stress ulcer prophylaxis. Communication was with the patient and
his [**Last Name (LF) 802**], [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 2013**] ([**Name (NI) 802**]) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 97950**]. Code status was
DNR/DNI, confirmed with HCP.
.
# Malnutrition: He failed swallowing test twice with concern for
aspiration.  PEG tube was placed and his tube feeds were
advanced to goal rate of 35 cc/hr.  Medium chain trigylcerides
were added for coloric help.
.
Follow up at Rehab
1. Sundowning: [**Month (only) 116**] increase his schedule dose of seroquel [**Hospital1 **]
and qhs. His QTc on current dose is only 419.  Please check EKG
after increasing his dose to ensure there is no significant QTc
prolongation.
