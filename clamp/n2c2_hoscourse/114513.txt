A 73yoM with parkinson disease, HTN, DM, systolic HF (EF 20% in
[**11-4**]), history of CVA (residual left visual field cut), AF s/p
AVN ablation and pacer, inmediate s/p BiV pacer upgrade with
slowly recover after sedation transfer to CCU for monitoring.
After the haldol wore off, mental status was felt to return to
baseline.  Of note, hematocrit was noted to drop on the day of
procedure.  CT abd/Pelvis was done and was negative for
retroperitoneal bleed.  Left upper extremity also noted to be
more swollen on [**1-18**] and ultrasound was performed which was
negative for DVT.

# mental status change: Patient likely sensitive to sedation,
requiring , more alert, able to follow simple commands. He is
able to movilize all extremities, still somnolent. more likely
given his baseline disease, he is more sensitive to sedation.
Patient seemed to recover in the 10-12 hours post-sedation.
Head CT was performed and was negative for intracranial bleed.
Neurology was consulted and agreed that mental status changes
likely to haldol being given.
.
1. Parkinson's disease: will continue home medications sinemet,
mirapex and pramipexol.

2. CV:
Rhythm: h/o Afib - heparin bridge to coumadin.  Heparin was
stopped in setting of hematocrit drop and restarted on [**2153-1-19**].
S/P BiV pacer- he was given Vancomycin Iv x 3 doses.
AV paced
Carvedilol continued for rate control
Pace maker checked on [**2153-1-19**].
Pump: EF 17% on MIBI, currently euvolemic. Will continue
Carvediolol and Furosemide home dose and digoxin. We will
recommend to discusse with your primary cardiologist regarding
Ace inhibitor medications
CAD: continue aspirin, statin, Carvedilol

3. Heme: On admission Hct noted to be 37.  This was likely
hemoconcentrated as Hcts from 3 weeks prior were 31-32.
However, given Hct decrease to 25, CT scan of Abd/Pelvis and
including upper thighs done and negative for hematoma or bleed.
He was tranfused 2 units of pRBCs and Hct increased. Hematocrit
should be monitored on an outpatient basis.

4. left upper extremity swelling: noted on [**1-18**].  Concern for
DVT or bleed. Ultrasound of upper extrmity done and negative for
DVT.

5. GERD: Continue Pantoprazole

6. FENA: Cardiac healthy -diabetic diet.

7.  Dispo: to rehab.  Patient should have Hematocrit checked on
[**1-22**] (Hct 27.6 on [**1-19**]).  Left upper extremity swelling seems to
be resolving.  His left arm may be elevated to decrease
swelling, but is not to be elevated above shoulder level given
new biVentricular pacemaker placement.
