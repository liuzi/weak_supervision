The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcohol
dependence who was recently discharged after detoxifying at [**Hospital1 1535**] but also suffering from
Wernicke-Korsakoff's syndrome, who presented from his nursing
facility with altered mental status.

#. Delirium/altered mental status: Patient had been agitated at
nursing facility. TSH, B12, folate, and lactate all within
normal limits. Ammonia also normal. Patient was been afebrile,
WBC was normal, CXR and UA negative. CT head was negative.
Neurology and Psychiatry consulted.  Psychiatry discovered that
patient was receiving oxazepam at facility. Combined with the
significant (12mg IV) lorazepam he received in Emergency
Department and 5mg IV more on initial evening in ICU,
benzodiazepine intoxication felt to be responsible for much of
altered mental status. Benzos stopped and replaced with Zyprexa
to a maximum dose of 35mg daily with monitoring of QTc (407 on
last day of ICU stay).  Patient continued on folate,
multivitamin, vitamin D and thiamine.  Patient restarted on home
olanzapine 5 mg QAM and 15 mg QPM per psychiatry recs.  EKG was
periodically monitored for prolongation of the QTc. He continued
to be agitated particularly at night and was started on
trazadone 100 mg QHS and mirtazepine 30 mg PO QHS.  He improved
on this regimen.  After originally planning to send the patient
to a dementia unit, eventually his brother made the decision to
take him home with 24 hour supervision at his home.  Vitamin
supplementation was discontinued on discharge as patient is no
longer drinking alcohol.  He will follow up frequently with his
PCP and will also follow up with cognitive neurology.

#. Hyponatremia: Patient presented with hyponatremia.  He may
have been volume down at his nursing facility, esecially if he
has been agitated and unable to take PO. During his last
hospitalization, his sodium was well within normal limits.
Sodium corrected to low normal with maintenance fluids.

# Back pain- Patient has migratory low back pain without any
neurological deficits or signs of infection. This is a chronic
issue for Mr. [**Known lastname 62523**]. He was treated with ibuprofen, tylenol
