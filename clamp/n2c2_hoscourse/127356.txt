60 yo woman with h/o mast cell degranulation syndrome presented
with abdominal pain, back pain, CP, sob and subjective tongue
swelling found to be c/w usual flares of MCDS.

1. Mast Cell Degranulation Syndrome: In ER was given usual
protocol with some relief: benadryl IV, dilaudid IV,
methylprednisolone, epinephrine x 3, zofran and a non-rebreather
mask.  On the floors, pt was started on her usual regimen of
gastrocrom (cromolyn), ranitidine, atarax, benadryl, and
fexofenadine.  Also given dilaudid, zofran, and ativan for
nausea per protocol.  Throughout admission, pt had 4 episodes of
CP and SOB that improved with a combination of reassurance,
benadryl, epinephrine, and/or dilaudid.  Pt was also continued
on predinsone 40.  These epsiodes were thought to be related to
anxiety and flare of mast cell degranulation.  Pt also had 1
episode of subjective tongue swelling and pruritus ([**6-27**]) that
also resolved with benadryl.  At discharge pt was tolerating PO
diet.  Allergy (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted to evaluate the role of
other pharmacologic therapies.  Pt was discharged with doxepin
25 qhs and singulair 10 qhs as recommended by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Pt
will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (see below for details of
appointment). It was also felt that pt would benefit from being
evaluated for OSA as she endorsed sxs of daytime fatigue and
dyspnea during sleep. Pt was also seen by speech therapy to
further evaluate her paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction as it
was felt that dyspnea secondary to paradoxical vocal function
may contribute further to her anxiety.  Outpatient speech
therapy training in diaphragmatic breathing techniques was
recommended.

2. HTN: Diltiazem was continued. BP fluctuations throughout
admission was thought to be secondary to pain and anxiety.

3. Depression/anxiety/bipolar/ADHD: Cymbalta and adderall were
continued.

4. Osteoarthritis: plaquenil was continued.
- Pt is to schedule appointment with rheumatology for
progressively worsening arthritis
