Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after transfer from OSH with
significantly sized intracranial hemorrhage while on
anticoagulation therapy from previous cardiac surgery. Upon
admission; she was administered platelets and admitted to the
intensive care unit for continuous monitoring. On [**4-3**], repeat
head CT was performed and determined to be stable, and not
indicitative of ongoing hemorrhage. She was subsequently
extubated. On [**4-4**], she was observed to have difficulty managing
her secretions, and an arterial blood gas was performed and
revealed a PaO2 in the 50s, and was reintubated. Head CT was
again performed to evaluate whether the ICH had evolved to
attribute to the poor respiratory effort, but was stable. On
[**4-5**], a bedside mini bronchoscopy was done to evaluate if she
had aspirated any secretions during her period of poor
respiratory effort. A lung consolidation was identified, and
antibiotics were started. On [**4-5**] her exam was stable and social
work was consulted for family regarding the possibility for
trach/peg & DNR/I status.  On [**4-6**] her sodium was 153, mannitol
was stopped, free H2O was increased to 150cc QID, and her exam
was stable.  On [**4-7**] she had a troponin leak 1.19 and a family
meeting w/ palliative care where the conclusion was to make her
CMO and she was eventually extubated and started on morphine for
comfort.  On [**4-8**] she passed away.
