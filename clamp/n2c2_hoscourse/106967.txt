53 y/o immunosuppressed female s/p renal transplant in [**Month (only) 958**]
[**2172**], presenting from PCP's office with three weeks of chills,
now with documented fevers tachycardia, borderline hypotension,
and hypoglycemia.
.
1. Sepsis secondary to ecoli bacteremia: On presentation, meet
SIRS criteria with fevers, tachycardia and mild bandemia from
suspected infectious source especially given immunosuppression.
Pancultured in the emergency department and placed on empiric
broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime.  To
evaluate for etiology, CXR and CT scan of abdomen was performed
with no apparent abnormality besides stool impaction in the
rectum.  Urinalysis did have minimal blood and white blood
cells, but culture returned negative.  Stool cx returned
positive for cdiff and patient was started on flagyl.  Blood cx
from [**10-5**] grew pansensitive ecoli and antibiotics were
subsequently narrowed to ciprofloxacin (and flagyl).  The most
likely source of ecoli bacteremia was thought to be
translocation from gut in setting of mild colitis.  The patient
was transiently hypotensive in the emergency department, but
responded to fluid boluses.  With antibiotic therapy, she
defervesced, tachycardia resolved, and subjective complaints of
chills improved.  Surveillance blood cx from [**10-6**] were negative
for 48 hrs, pt was continued on cipro/flagyl but developed
leukopenia and flagyl was discontinued (bc can contribute to
leukopenia) and changed to PO vancomycin. Authorization for PO
vanco could not be obtained over the weekend and pt decided to
leave against medical advice in lieu of waiting for vanco
authorization. Pt was advised to continue vanco for 2 weeks more
after completing 2 week course of cipro. She has outpt f/u in
transplant clinic to have WBC count checked (in addition to INR
and tacro levels, as below). At time of discharge, pt was
abebrile >72 hrs, had no diarrhea, no abd pain, no N/V. Of note,
mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued as well prior to
discharge given leukopenia. Bactrim and valcyte, though also can
cause leukopenia, were continued as pt has been on these for a
long time without complications. Most likely leukopenia was due
to recent initiation of flagyl, and should improve on
cipro/vanco regimen.  MMF was held until follow up as this may
have been contributing to her neutropenia.
.
2. ESRD s/p transplant: History of lupus nephritis s/p renal
transplant on cellcept, tacrolimus and prednisone.  Baseline
creatinine is in the 1s, but has been slowly increasing since
[**Month (only) 205**] and has been as high as 2.7 in the recent past.  Etiology
of developping renal insufficiency is unclear: CT scan with no
evidence of obstruction, urinalysis without active sediment to
suggest recurrent lupus nephritis.  The patient may have chronic
volume depletion, she is on bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] which may
artifactually increase creatinine.  Also, it is unclear whether
she is compliant with her immunosuppressants at home.  A renal
biopsy may be pursued as an outpatient.  During hospitalization,
renal function was trended daily and patient continued on
immunosuppressants with bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].  Daily tacrolimus
levels were also followed with level adjusted as needed. Goal
level [**7-20**], tacro level 6.4 at discharge, per renal consult
continued 2mg [**Hospital1 **] dosing of tacrolimus. Cellcept was
discontinued prior to discharge given leukopenia (as above). Pt
has f/u in renal transplant clinic to have tacro levels
rechecked and to check WBC count, will modulate
immunosuppression regimen based on those results.
.
3. Antiphospholipid syndrome:  on longterm anticoagulation with
warfarin for history of APLS (Anticardiolipin Ab's showing
elevated IgG and normal IgM in [**3-17**] and [**7-17**]) with multiple
prior thrombotic occlusions of dialysis fistula. PT/INR followed
daily with warfarin supratherapeutic on [**10-6**] to 4.7.  INR at
2.9 to 2.1 on discharge (goal [**1-13**]). Coumadin was restarted at
1mg daily with f/u day after discharge to check INR levels and
to adjust coumadin accordingly.
.
4.  SLE: Outpatient rheumatology notes indicate patient
diagnosed in [**2165**] and initially seen at [**Hospital1 112**] lupus clinic. Last
[**Hospital1 18**] rheumatology clinic visit [**1-20**], documenting history of
lupus nephritis and AVN of ankles  with last documented [**Doctor First Name **]
positive 1:160 in [**2169**], though dsDNA Ab's have been negative
when checked since [**2171**].  No findings on history or physical
consistent with lupus flair.
.
5.  Hypertension: Pt has history of hypertension treated with
metoprolol only, with past systolic blood pressure measurements
documented in the 110-140 range, per OMR. Documented BP's in ED
generally in low 100s, with IVF infusion.  Given systemic HTN,
home metoprolol initially held but restarted prior to discharge.
.
6. Hyperlipidemia: Last lipid panel in [**2172-9-10**], with TC
144, HDL 39, LDL 81, TG 120. Not currently receiving treatment,
but was taking simvastatin through [**2172-3-11**].
.
7. Hyponatremia: Mild, without alterations in mental status.
Likely poor PO intake over past days-weeks would suggest
hypovolemic hyponatremia. Improved following IVF bolus in
emergency department.
.
8. Osteoporosis: Last bone densitometry scan in [**2173-4-10**],
consistent with osteoporosis, in setting of chronic
glucocorticoid therapy and hyperparathyroidism.
