64 y/o African American male with a PMH of DMII and HTN who
presented with generalized weakness, altered mental status,
slurred speech and increased frequency of small amounts of
urination.  He was found to be in acute renal failure at an OSH
and transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible hemodialysis.  He was
stabilized medically in the ICU until [**7-16**] when his care was
transitioned to the general medicine service.

**ACUTE ISSUES**
# Acute Renal Failure: He presented in acute renal failure with
creatinine of 10.4 (baseline 0.9), hyperkalemia, and EKG
changes.   His ARF was largely attributed to obstruction as he
was retaining over 500cc urine and found to have large symmetric
prostate on DRE.  However, no hydronephrosis seen on ultrasound.
 Additionally, he was also on a number of potentially
nephrotoxigenic medications causing ATN, including lisinopril,
NSAIDs, and potassium citrate. He was initially medically
managed in the ICU IVF, lasix, bicarb with good effect.  Renal
function gradually improved over several days following catheter
placement, fluid support, and discontinuation of nephrotoxigenic
drugs.  He was discharged with a Cr of 5.7, and not restarted on
his nephrotoxic meds.  He will be followed by renal as an
outpatient.  Furthermore, he was started on Tamsulosin for his
BPH.  His foley remained in place to allow [**5-26**] day bladder rest
before urology will try voiding trial as an outpatient in the
next few days.

#Hyperkalemia: He was found to have an elevated K 8 with
associated peaked T waves. Potassium levels dropped with
administration of kayexalate, insulin, and bicarbonate. Serial
EKGS also showed resolution of peaked T waves.

#DM II: Prior to this admission, he was only taking oral
hypoglycemics.  However, these were discontinued in light of his
ARF.  His blood sugars were managed on sliding scale insulin.
Since he required Humalog 5-7 units for the last 3 days of
hospitalization, he was sent home on Lantus 2units QHS with
lispro sliding scale coverage.  He will be followed by his PCP
in the next 2-3 days for follow-up  of this new diabetes
regimen.  He was also provided with an educational counseling
session regarding home insulin.  His oral hypoglycemics were
held, with the goal of transitioning back to agents after renal
approval and Cr normalization.

#BPH:  As above, his BPH contributed to urinary obstruction and
ARF.  DRE revealed symmetric enlargement of prostate.  Previous
biopsy was benign.  Was started on Tamsulosin this admission.
Urology will follow in clinic for void trial.

**CHRONIC ISSUES**
# Hypertension: He was found to be hypertensive to SBP 180s
during the admission as his ACE-I was held in light of his ARF.
After transfer to the floor, he was continued on his Amlodipine
5mg and Metoprolol succinate 100 daily.  Quinapril discontinued
indefinitely. Tamsulosin added for BPH.

# Hyperlipidemia: Stable, continued his home statin.

**TRANSITIONAL ISSUES**
-Urology outpatient follow up: The patient will be called by
urology for an appointment this week.  Until then, foley will
remain in place and he will be visited by VNA for foley-related
care.
-Renal outpatient follow up to readdress kidney function and
possibility of restoring prior home meds: quinapril, metformin,
glipizide
-PCP follow up in the next couple days to follow up glucose
control on newly started insulin regimen and antihypertensive
regimen, and side effects to newly started Tamsulosin. Also
should repeat chem 7 to follow up K and Cr.
-Following meds should not be restarted until clearance from
renal:  quinipril, metformin, glipizide, NSAIDS, KCL
