73 year old man with COPD (FEV1 0.96), HTN, hyperlipidemia and
recent GIB from PUD presents 2 days post discharge, intubated at
home by paramedics after c/o increasing dyspnea.

# Respiratory failure likely related to COPD exacurbation:
History surrounding intubation and presentation is largely
unknown as he does not come with EMS paperwork and friend listed
as contact is unaware of the details.  It appears that he had
been doing okay at home since his d/c on [**12-17**], but complained
to his friend over the phone that he needed help d/t increasing
SOB (which prompted EMS call).  Per verbal s/o from ED, he had
been prescribed prednisone upon discharge on [**12-17**] for COPD
exacerbation, but pt did not pick up prescription.  He was
intubated on presentation to the ED on last presentation as well
presumably thought d/t COPD exacerbation.  Was diagnosed with PE
on last admission by CTA on [**12-10**] ("Isolated subsegmental
pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe of uncertain clinical
significance").  He was on heparin and discharged on coumadin
for this finding and repeat CTA on this presentation does not
even comment on subsegmental PE on prelim read so seems very
unlikely to be causing clinical presentation.  No e/o volume
overload nor of pneumonia on CT chest and unable to obtain hx
re: cough/sputum production. The patient was given IV steroids
which was subsequently trasitioned to oral prednisone with
[**Doctor Last Name 2949**]. He was continued on standing MDIs and was given
azithromycin. Sputum and blood cultures were no growth to date.


# Hypotension:  Normally hypertensive at baseline.  Presented
with SBPs in the 90s where he has largely remained stable
despite 6L IVFs.  Unclear etiology. Infection suspected
initially but his UA was unremarkable and his CT of chest
without e/o infiltrate. No other signs of infection were
evident.  [**Month (only) 116**] be partially med related (fentanyl/versed).  His
SBPs improved during the hospitalization and remained stable
without IVF.

# PE:  On [**12-10**] CTA chest showed small subsegmental PE for which
he was heparinized then transitioned to coumadin for discharge.
INR has been therapeutic and repeat CTA today with prelim report
showing no PE.  Goal INR per d/c summary was 2-2.5 given recent
GIB; INR currently 2.7. Anticoagulation was continued during
this admission.

# Positive cardiac biomarkers:  With elevated CK and MB although
neg MB index; troponin positive at 0.30.  Trop could be up in
setting of PE, but PE on last admission seems so small
(subsegmental) that it is unlikely to be the underlying cause of
his hypoxia and positive trop.  EKG did show probable a.flutter
with rate in the 120s so demand ischemia possible. Continued
statin and ASA; holding BB given relative hypotension.
Cardiology saw the patient and recomended outpatient follow up.

# PUD and recent UGIB:  Serology positive for H. pylori.  It
appears that he was initiated on amoxacillin and clarithromycin
on [**12-4**] and thus, should have completed a full 2 week course at
this time. We continued [**Hospital1 **] PPI and sucralfate

# A. fib/flutter:  EKG from [**12-16**] shows a. fib.  Does not appear
to have diagnsosis of this prior to that.  CHADS2 score of [**12-27**]
with HTN and age nearly >75.  He is currently anticoagulated and
INR is therapeutic.

# Lung nodule:  5-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule on [**12-10**]
CT chest for which a six-month recommended.
