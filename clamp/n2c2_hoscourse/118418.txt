  The patient was admitted with cellulitis
and was placed on IV vancomycin.  Doxycycline was added when
he did not appear to be improving.  Unasyn was added when the
cellulitic area continued to worsen.  He also became short of
breath and was treated with Lasix.  Transthoracic echo
revealed diastolic heart failure and he was continued on
enalapril and Lasix.  He had an ID consult on [**1-28**] who
suggested stopping the Unasyn, changing to cefepime and
adding vancomycin back.  Blood cultures remained negative and
he was afebrile throughout this time.  Derm consult on [**1-28**]
was obtained due to persistent rash, and a biopsy was
performed consistent with melanoma.  He was subsequently
transferred to the biologic service on [**2178-1-30**] to begin
high-dose IL-2 therapy.

During this week he received 7 of 14 doses with 7 doses held
related to tachycardia and pulmonary edema.  On treatment day
#4, he was tachypneic with hypoxia to the mid 80s.  Chest x-
ray was consistent with bilateral pleural effusions.
Throughout the day he became increasingly more tachypneic and
fatigued, and was transferred to the ICU.  He was treated
with Lasix with improvement in his respiratory status.  An
echocardiogram on [**2178-2-3**] showed a small pericardial
effusion with question tamponade physiology.  Cardiology was
consulted and felt they were not able to tap the effusion.
He underwent a cardiac MRI on [**2178-2-4**] revealing no cardiac
metastases and no tamponade physiology.

He developed SVT to the 140s on [**2178-2-4**], which
spontaneously improved with a fluid bolus.  His respiratory
status improved with continued diuresis, and he was
transferred back to the floor on [**2178-2-5**].  Lasix and
enalapril were continued and he was weaned to room air with
O2 saturations in the mid 90s.

Physical therapy consult was initiated and he was ambulating
short distances with a steady gait.  He was discharged to
home on [**2178-2-7**] with a plan to follow up in clinic on
[**2178-2-10**].

Other side effects related to IL-2 included rigors improved
with Demerol; fatigue; and hypotension on treatment day 3,
requiring fluid boluses.  During this week he developed acute
renal failure with a peak creatinine of 3.0 with associated
oliguria.  He developed metabolic acidosis with a minimum
bicarb of 18, improved with bicarbonate boluses.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted per protocol.
Strict I & Os and serum chemistries were maintained.  IV
fluids were continued given acute renal failure.

During this week he had mild ST elevation to 54, which
improved prior to discharge.  He had no hyperbilirubinemia,
myocarditis or coagulopathy noted.  He was thrombocytopenic
to a platelet count low of 68,000 without evidence of
bleeding.  He was anemic and was transfused with packed red
blood cells with discharge hemoglobin of 9.1.  By [**2178-2-7**]
he had recovered from side effects to allow for discharge to
home.
