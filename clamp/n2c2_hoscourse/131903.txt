63 y.o. F with h/o ESRD on HD, s/p failed b/l kidney
transplants, who presented from OSH with unresponsiveness
witness facial twiching/seizure at the end of her HD session,
subsequent unresponsiveness, hyperkalemia, hypertension, and
failure to protect her airway due to angioedema resulting in
intubation and subsequent L sided pneumothorax.
.
# Pneumothorax - Patient did have a transient 20 second hypoxic
episode to Sats of 60s that quickly reocvered.  She continued to
oxygenate well.  Her CT was draining minimally.  The subsequent
repeat CXR showed L lung reexpansion.  CT to be d/c once patient
is extubated.  Thoracics service placed the CT at bedside and
followed the patient during her hospital course
.
# Respiratory failure, angioedema - patient was intubated due to
angioedema.  The intubation was medium complexity with moderate
swelling of visual cords visualized.  Patient required use of a
bouje, with a subsequent 7.0 ETT reinsertion after 6.5 was
placed initially.  She did have a brief episode of desaturation
to 60s for 20 seconds that improved with ventilation.  Patient's
course was complicated by PTX as described above.  Patient was
initially started on steroids, benadryl and famotadine was it
was unclear whether her angioedema was due to dilantin (24 hours
prior to ICU transfer) or CT dye allergy vs SVC syndrome.  After
obtaining UE ultrasound and the swelling of the neck along with
UE swelling.  Patient was subsequently taken off steroids after
2 days and was continued on heparin gtt.  Patient underwent SVC
gram for possible definitive diagnosis of SVC clot, however the
study was limited due to failure of progression of the dye to
the SVC from the SCL due to several likely obstructions.  Per IR
thrombectomy would have been a very technically difficult
procedure.  Patient with good pulmonary mechanics after
improvement in her likely VAP as described below but continues
to have no cuff leak, thus suggesting persistent vocal cord
edema.  On [**1-17**] patient was also noted to have opacification of
L lung on the Xray suggesting diffuse alveolar process or
possible lung collapse or plugging.   There was no mediastinal
shift or air to suggest new PTX.  Heparin drip was continued.
She was eventually extubated on [**1-19**] but reintubated on [**1-20**] for
increased stridor and concern for loss of airway. She got a
tracheostomy on [**1-21**] and PEG on [**1-23**]. Her secretions decreased
and she had an adequate cough reflex, sufficient for management
on the floor.
.
SVC syndrome/multiple upper extrmity clots. She had a
thrombectomy for this on [**1-23**]. She was bridge from heparin to
coumadin, and is now on coumadin 5mg daily with a therapeutic
INR.
.
# Hypotension - initial hypotension was felt to be due to
pneumothorax and propofol, antihypertensive medications received
during intubation.  It quickly resolved with 250 cc NS bolus and
patient in a few hours required antihypertensives to keep her
SBP <200.  On [**1-15**] patient patient suddently became hypotensive
after pulmonary toileting along with tachypnea and tachycardia.
Patient responded to 250 cc NS bolus again with improvement in
her BP with SbP to 110s and MAPs > 65.  There was no evidence of
new re-expended tension pneumothorax.  It was felt to be due to
possible VAP and she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics
as below. Patient hypotensive again on [**1-30**], after HD. resolved
with lying flat and 1 unit prbcs.
.
# VAP - patient's secretions worsened on [**1-14**], and she became
transiently hypotensive on [**1-15**] AM.  She was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics - Vanco/Zosyn.  Her cultures remained
negative and her sputum Cx was felt to be contaminated and did
not grow out pulmonary pathogens.  Her WBC was elevated but
improved after institution of antibiotics.  Patient was off
steroids x 2 days during the leukocytosis increase, thus making
demargination less likely. She completed an 8 day course of
vancomycin and Zosyn with no microbe isolated.
.
# Seizures - Patient initially presented with facial twitching
in the ED, that improved with ativan and was felt to be
consistent with a clinical seizure. Thus she was loaded with
dilantin and was admited to neurology service.  However, further
review of her EEG failed to caputre true epileptiforms and her
presentation was felt to be consistent with toxic metabolic
encephalpathy that may have precipitate a seizure especially
with hyperkalemia.  Patient remained without any clinical signs
of seizure while in ICU on propofol, she was mentating and
interacting on [**1-17**].  Her EEG also did not show any new siezure
activity.  Neurology service was following the patient and
decided that she did not need additional antiseizure medication.

.
Rt femoral hematoma: Patient had femoral line placed on [**1-15**] on
rt side. after being called out to the floor on [**1-25**], she
started c/o of severe rt groin pain. hematoma was  palpated, no
bruits. An u/s showed a large hematoma in the thigh. Her Hct had
been trending down since the placement of the line, so a CT was
done to assess for retroperitoneal hematoma. The obutrator
internis muscle was slight enlarged, consistent with small
retropertineal bleed. No acute drop in Hct. She did have 1 unit
PRBCs for hct of 23. She was also intermittently with low grade
fever, which may have been from the hematoma.  Hematoma steadily
resolved and repeat imaging showed no progression.
.
# Foreign Body - CT scan of the abdomen performed for abdominal
pain demonstrated a small jejunal foreign body 2cm in length.
Interventional radiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] who felt the foreign body
was related to the placement of the G-J tube and stated that
there is a small cap associated with the J-tube that normally
breaks off and is passed in the stool.  After discussion with IR
and surgery it was felt that there was no need for intervention
at this time, and that the object should pass on its own without
difficulty.  If desired, repeat imaging at a point in the near
future could be obtained to follow the passage of the cap, but
was not felt to be necesarry at this time.
.
# ESRD - s/p renal transplant; patient with 2 failed kidney
transplants in LLQ; she does not need to be on tacrolimus
anymore. HD continued.
.
# h/o b/l IJ thrombosis - on coumadin at home, but not
therapeutic. Heparin gtt while in house, transitioned to
coumadin.
.
# DM - RISS, of note hypoglycemic during initial ED presentation
to 30s.
.
# Hypertension - initially hypertensive to 220s during ED and
ICU presentation. She was eventually converted to amlodipine
10mg daily, captopril 12.5mg TID, and metoprolol 25mg TID with
room to increase as tolerated.
.
# Atrial fibrillation - on [**1-19**] she had an episode of unstable
atrial fibrillation which produced blood pressures in the 60's
systolic; she was cardioverted x 1 with good response.  Briefly
on amiodarone and remained in sinus thereafter.  Currently
anticoagulated with coumadin.
.
# Hyperlipidemia - lipitor 20 mg daily
.
# Depression - Zoloft 100 mg daily
.
# R femoral TLC placed on [**1-15**] in IR, after failed attempts x 3
by bedside, know IJ occlusions with slow subclavian flow and
likely SVC occlusion.
