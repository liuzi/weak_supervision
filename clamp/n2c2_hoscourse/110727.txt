38 years old male with psoriatic arthritis on immunosuppression,
DM, HTN, HL p/w LLE erythema, swelling and pain, found to have
gastrocnemius abscesses and overlying cellulitis.
.
# Acute renal failure: Patient noted to have acutely elevated
creatinine after I&D by surgery.  All urine lytes testing
indicated pre-renal etiology. Resolved after fluid challenge. He
again had acute renal failure on [**2202-1-27**] in the setting of having
received increased doses of pain medications and resultant
hypoperfusion. His peak creatinine was 3.0, and resolved to his
baseline of 0.8-0.9 by the time of discharge.
.
# Left calf fluid collection with overlying cellulitis: No DVT
or [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst on multiple imaging studies.  No compartment
syndrome per Orthopedic evaluation.  No osteomyelitis on MRI and
not consistent with necrotizing fascitis per Vascular surgery.
It was noted on imaging that he had gastroceminis fluid
collection and overlying cellulitis.  No signs of septic joint
from evaluation of knee aspiration.  He had one positive blood
culture with pan-sensitive staph.  He was placed on zosyn, later
narrowed to nafcillin.  All other microbiology data were
negative.  IR and vascular surgery helped drained the fluid
collection.  Leg incision is to heal via secondary intention.
He developed a body rash that was determined to be folliculitis.
 He completed the 2 week course IV antibiotics in house.  His
major issue remained to be pain management.  He required a large
amount of narcotics to control his pain, but after overdose (see
below) he was switched to a very conservative regimen.  It was
determined that the swelling/fluid collection is from psoriatic
arthritis versus idiopathic spondylarthropathy. He was
discharged in stable condition. Muscle biospy showed necrotic
muscle with granulation tissue.
.
# Medication overdose: On [**2202-1-26**], on recommendation from the
pain service, patient's MS Contin dose was increased to 160 mg
TID from 130 mg TID, in addition to being ordered for PRN
Dilaudid. Later that night, Pt fell while ambulating. He had a
CT scan which was negative for acute intracranial pathologu.
Morning after the fall, Pt was noted to be somnolent and
hypotensive. He was given Naloxone 0.4 mg X3 and would arouse
briefly after each dose. He continued to be hypotensive after a
bolus of 1L of NS. He was transferred to the MICU for further
monitoring. In the MICU he was monitored closely and his
hypotension and mental status gradually improved. He was called
out back to the floor on [**2202-1-28**]. He never required intubation.
After being called out, he was normotensive and alert and
oriented X 3. It was believed his hypotension and altered mental
status were caused by medication overdose in the setting of
acute kidney injury.  He was discharged on oxycodone 5mg Q4
hours, which he did well on for the 3 days prior to his
discharge. He will follow up with the pain clinic as an
outpatient.
.
# Psoriatic arthritis: On Golimumab every month, azathioprine,
prednisone. Rheumatology was consulted and suggested to decrease
prednison level to 20mg from 30 mg.  He continued on PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
with Bactrim.  Indomethacin was held due to renal failure but
restarted on discharge.  He will continue to follow with
rhematology as an outpatient.
.
# DM: Continued on Lantus 8u qAM, 10u qPM with sliding scale
dictated by patient based on carbohydrate counting.  [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted and followed.
.
# HTN: Continued on HCTZ 25mg, lisinopril 40mg, metoprolol
succinate 100mg [**Hospital1 **].  Held HCTZ and lisinopril due to
ARF/hypotension and was restarted afterwards.
.
# Anemia: Patient found to be iron deficient and started on
supplementation. Patient informed he will need oupatient
evaluation to determine cause of this by his PCP.  (PCP informed
by letter).

# HL: Continued pravastatin
.
# OSA: Continued CPAP qhs
.
# GERD: Continued Donnatal prn
