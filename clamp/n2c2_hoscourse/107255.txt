64F DMII on insulin, HTN and HL admitted with junctional rhythm,
hypotension and acute kidney injury in the setting of likely
beta-blocker toxicity. Pt had an episode of acute respiratory
distress during admission requiring intubation.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# Junctional rhythm: The patient presented to the ED with HR in
the 50s and BP of 69/54. EKG showed junctional rhythm. She was
given glucagon 5 mg IV x 1 out of concern for beta-blocker
toxicity. In the CCU, 1 mg atropine was administered with good
response and improvement in HR. She was started on an
epinephrine gtt with improvement in HR, dripp was d/c'ed on
[**7-11**]. ECHO [**7-11**] revealed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with hyperdynamic left ventricular function and
right ventricular dilation and dysfunction.
.
# Hypotension: Likely mixed cardiogenic and hypovolemic. She
received ~ 3L of IVF in the ED and additional 1L on presentation
to the CCU. Epinephrine gtt was started with improvement in BP
so d/c'ed on [**7-11**]. AM Cortisol and TSH were normal. TTE showed
hyperdynamic LV function, dilated and depressed contractility of
the RV. Following BP normalization the pt became hypertensive
(see below).
.
# CMP: Pt underwent cardiac cath [**7-12**] as part of work-up for
admission with junctional rhythm, hypotension and abnormal ECHO
with RV dilation. Cath revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension
and elevated right and left sided filling pressures without
hemodynamic evidence supporting constriction. DDx included
restrictive process vs dCHF and pulmonary HTN. No evidence of
valvular stenosis or angiographically-apparent CAD was noted.
Thus, the pt was not placed on ASA. Pt to f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
within the next two weeks. Also, the pt was instructed to
reschedule pulm f/u as she missed her appointment with pulm
while in-patient.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr was 3.3, up from baseline of 1.1 in [**Month (only) 956**]. K was
4.2, BUN 67. Likely prerenal from volume depletion given history
of nausea/vomiting x 1 week. Cr stabilized over the course of
the hospitalization. Appropriate medications were renally dosed.
[**Last Name (un) **] was discontinued during hospitalization with plans for
further discussion as outpatient for restarting given pt with hx
of DMII.
.
# Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Likely due to a
combination of flash pulmonary edema and anxiety. In the
afternoon of [**7-11**], pt became acutely dyspneic and tachypneic.
She had bilateral diffuse crackles and CXR showing diffuse
bilateral infiltrates. She was given morphine 2mg IV x2, Lasix
40mg IV x1 and started on a nitro gtt. Pt was also placed on
CPAP however had difficulty tolerating and began to tire with an
ABG 7.23/42/89/18/-9. Anesthesia attempted intubation but had
initial difficulty and pt desatted, briefly became hypotensive
to the 60s, and had junctional rhythm in the 20s. She was given
atropine x1 with increase of HR to 110s and SBP to the 160s. Pt
was successfully intubated. After aggressive diuresis (out 3L),
pt was successfully extubated in the PM of [**7-12**] with no further
episodes of distress. The pt will be calling to schedule f/u up
with pulm in 2 weeks time.
.
# Hypertension: After d/c of epi gtt, pt's BPs elevated to the
160s. After starting pt on 25mg HCTZ (home dose), 10mg
Amlodipine, metoprolol 25 mg po BID, and aggressive diuresis,
BPs improved although still elevated. Losartan was held to
simplify home regimen and decrease risk of future incidence of
renal failure in setting of vomitting and diarrhea.
.
# Microcytic anemia: Hct was 25.5 on admission. Iron studies
consistent with AOCD.  EGD in [**2124**] showed gastritis which could
represent mixed iron deficiency and AOCD.  Guiaic negative in
the ED. Retic count was depressed at 1.6%. Hemolysis labs were
negative. Hct remained stable.
**The etiology of the patients AOCD remained unclear at the time
of discharge and should be further pursed as an outpatient**
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Type 2 DM: Blood sugars were initially low normal. Her sugars
were well-controlled on an insulin sliding scale.  Home dose of
NPH was held due to episode of hypoglycemia (BG=59). Pt
discharged on [**Last Name (un) **] humalin regimen.
.
# HLD: Continued simvastatin 20 mg po qdaily
.
# Depression: Continued on sertraline 150mg po daily.
Desipramine 100 mg was held during hospitalization but resumed
on discharge.
.
# Chronic back pain: Percocet 1-2 tabs po q6 prn pain while in
house. Pt continued on Oxycontin 10mg [**Hospital1 **] on d/c. (Pt on
contract).
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Full Code. Pt was given phone numbers for cardiology and
pulmonary and must call to make f/u appointments. A medication
list (and actual bottles) were reviewed with pt and her daughter
prior to discharge. Pt will have visiting nursing care for
medication management post hospitalization.
