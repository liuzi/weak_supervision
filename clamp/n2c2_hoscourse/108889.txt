oriented and breathing comfortably.  By POD 2 the patient was
hemodynamically stable, weaned from vasopressor/inotropic
support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without incident.  Ms.
