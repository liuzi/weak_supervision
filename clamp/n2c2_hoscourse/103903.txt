Patient was a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with h.o CHF, DM, afib, who
presented with invasive scalp squamous cell carcinoma with
intracranial extension who died after code status was CMO.
.
# CMO - Had family meeting [**6-10**]. Discussed to stop vital signs,
non-essential medications other than eye drops, pain meds, and
PO antibiotics. Patient was continued on maintainance IV fluids.
.
# Pain control - This was the family's primary goal of care.
There were multiple etiologies of the pain including her chonic
right shoulder pain, sacral decubiti with possible abcess,
painful scalp leison, or the >15cm pelvic mass. Pain control was
transitioned from outpatient oxycontin pills to fenanyl patch
and oxycodone liquid. Patient was comfortably sedated and only
required additional pain medication when she was moved.
Palliative care was involved in pain management.
.
# Squamous cell ca, intracranial- The carcinoma developed over
an unknown time period. It probably developed before her care to
nursing home facility given that there was a rapid decline in
her functional status and intracraninal involvement of the
tumor.  She was evaluated as an outpatient by dermatology and
was determined to have a squamous cell ca as per biopsy on [**5-25**].
Initially, the family wanted to have a neurosurgical
intervention, but the patient's INR was 7.7 so she was
transferred to the MICU for reversal. Later, the family decided
not to have surgery once it became apparent that the morbity was
high. Patient was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for
meningitis ppx and this was changed to PO cefepoxidime after a
family meeting determining that she would not want IV
antibiotics. Wound care was done to address her head wound.
.
# Resolved hypovolemia/ acute renal failure/ hypernatremia -
secondary to dehydration and intravascular hypovolemia in the
setting of diruetic use. Cr 2.0 on admission, most recent
baseline at [**Hospital1 18**] 1.1. This was the reason for the PICC line
placement and why the family wanted IVF.
.
# Pelvic mass - There is a large > 15 cm cystic pelvic mass seen
on renal ultrasound. This may be a source of pain.
.
# afib not on anticoagulation - Patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation but was placed on anticoagulation for a recent
phelbiltis. Given that the scalp wound oozes blood, the family
has decided that they do not want anticoagulation.
