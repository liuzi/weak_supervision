The patient was admitted for management of her large
intraparenchymal bleed.  The etiology was thought to be most
likely from amyloid angiopathy.  The neurosurgery team consulted
and the patient and discussed options with the family and it was
decided that surgery (draining the lesion) would not likely
benefit the patient.  She was loaded with dilantin.  Her exam
remained stable.  The family made the patient DNR but not DNI.
A family meeting was held and the family decided in favor of
placing a tracheostomy tube and a PEG tube.  These procedures
were done without complication.  The patient was initially
placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis due to her ICH.  She
had no events and the dilantin was eventually d/c'd.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable.  She has a goal SBP of
110-150.  The patient did appear to have a slight rash on her
truck upon d/c that was attributed to her dilantin that was
recently d/c'd.  On [**7-31**] she spiked a fever to 103 she remianed
febrile for ~ 5 days.  Eventually she had a sputum culture + for
staph aureus.  The patient was started on levofloxacin for a 10
day course.  At the time of d/c she was afebrile.  She was
accepted for placement at [**Hospital3 7**].
