66 yo man h/o severe emphysema who presented with a new
diagnosis of APML and NSTEMI with EF 30%, s/p intubation [**9-20**]
with extubation on [**9-27**], found to have large IPH, multiple
strokes, and endocarditis.

# APML: Mr. [**Known lastname 104371**] was diagnosed with APML by peripheral smear,
flow cytometry, and PCR of the blood. He was treated with ATRA
and hydroxyurea initially and when his WBC was <10K, his
hydroxyurea was stopped. He also received steroids initially for
prophylaxis of ATRA syndrome and this was gradually weaned. He
was monitored for tumor lysis and DIC and transfused blood
products prn to keep his fibrinogen >100 and INR <1.5. His
platelet goal was initially 20K but this was increased to 100K
after his intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

# NSTEMI with new heart failure (EF 35%): Mr. [**Known lastname 104371**] initially
presented to his PCP's office with chest pain. He had elevated
troponins on admission with no ST or T wave changes on EKG, c/w
NSTEMI. We trended his troponins which plateaued at 3.50. His
first ECHO showed moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis, with some regional variation (the anterior septum,
anterior free wall, and apex appearing more hypokinetic than the
other walls) and LVEF = 30 %. He was monitored on telemetry and
had no significant arrhythmias. Given his concurrent IPH (see
below), antiplatelet & anticoagulant agents are contraindicated
and he was medically managed with nitrates, beta-blockers,
low-dose ACE-i and a statin. Repeat ECHO on [**2148-9-25**] showed a
persistent small vegetation of the mitral valve, complex,
non-mobile atheroma of the aortic arch, and mild regional LV
systolic dysfunction (EF 45%).

# Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: On the morning of [**2148-9-23**], it
was noted that Mr. [**Known lastname 104371**] was not moving his L arm. CT head
showed a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal
lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect. A
hypodense lesion with smaller hemorrhagic component was also
seen in the right occipital lobe, with two additional
non-hemorrhagic hypodense lesions seen in the left cerebellar
hemisphere and the right parieto-occipital cortex. MRI/A on
[**2148-9-24**] revealed multiple areas of acute infarction, many with
hemorrhage, with a distribution that suggests emboli from a
proximal source, likely cardiac. Unclear etiology for embolism ??????
blood cultures are negative to date to assess for bacteremia.
TEE showed aortic plaque that could be potential embolic source.
 MRA showed a 5-6mm communicating artery aneurysm as well.
Neurosurgery had no plans for intervention. Neurology was
consulted & recommended EEG which showed a diffuse
encephalopathy pattern and a focal area with epileptogenic
potential, but no electrographic seizures. All
antiplatelet/anticoagulant agents were held.  DIC labs were
stable, with a platelet count goal of >100K. He was able to be
extubated on [**2148-9-27**] and PT/OT was consulted for help
managing/recovering from his stroke. He continued to suffer from
mood lability on the floor and intermittently refused his
medications. Neurology continued to follow him. EEG was repeated
and did not show any seizure activity, just a diffuse
encephalopathy. Haldol 0.5mg IV was used [**Hospital1 **] prn for mood
stabilization as he refused.

# Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: On presentation, he was hypoxic
and required oxygen support by nasal cannula (up to 6L). It was
felt to be multifactorial, with his underlying emphysema, acute
systolic heart failure, pulmonary edema, and pneumonia
contributing. Following his IPH, he was intubated for airway
protection on [**2148-9-20**] with successful extubation on [**2148-9-27**].
Bronchoscopy on [**2148-9-26**] showed edematous airways with
friability but no frank blood. BAL grew yeast (it was initially
reported as mold, concerning for Aspergillus, but
galactomannan/glucan were normal and it was re-read as yeast).
He is s/p 8 day course of cefepime and levofloxacin for his
pneumonia. Following extubation, he was maintained on his home
COPD medications and was maintaining stable O2 sats on room air.


# Culture-negative endocarditis:  ECHO on [**2148-9-25**] showed a
small vegetation on mitral valve.  Unclear if this is infectious
versus malignant.  Added vancomycin (d1=[**9-25**]) for MRSA
endocarditis coverage and started ceftriaxone (d1=[**9-27**]).  Had
abdominal CT [**2148-9-26**] which did not show any infectious source.
Per ID, 6 week course of antibiotics recommended.

# LUE edema: LUE>RUE edema, of hand and arm. Patient had PICC
placed in left arm [**2148-9-27**] and his edema was concerning for
DVT. Given his recent IPH, anticoagulation was not an option.
Left upper extremity U/S done on [**2148-9-27**] to r/o DVT was
negative. Edema and pain persisted, so a repeat LUE U/S was done
on [**2148-10-3**] and showed extensive DVT of the L subclavian,
axillary and basilic vein. The PICC line was removed on [**2148-10-3**]
and a peripheral IV was placed.

On [**2148-10-4**], the family expressed a desire to transfer his care
to [**Hospital1 2025**]. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (NI) 653**] the inpatient hematologic malignancy
team who accepted the patient in transfer.
