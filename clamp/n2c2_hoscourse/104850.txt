Assessment: 51 yo m with AIDS, recent diagnosis of PE, pulmonary
nodules, fevers, and shock. His shock is most likely due to
sepsis given his increasing WBC and low CVP making right heart
strain from PE unlikley.
.
Plan:
# Septic shock: He seems to be in distributive shock. Most
likely this is sepsis, given that he is immunocompromised with
fevers and respiratory distress. However,  Adrenal insufficiency
unlikely given normal [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test. Given his
immunocomprimised state, he has many potential sources for
sepsis including bactreial, fungal, and viral. Infectious
disease was consulted who recommended continue treatment with
caspofungin, azithromycin, imipenem-cilastin. Continue
antiretrovirals and bactrim ppx.  Unclear source at this point.
So far all cultures NGTD, cryptococcus, CMV, and histo
serologies negative, AFB x3, PCP stain, [**Name9 (PRE) 20613**] ag, negative.  Pt
was placed on Sepsis protocol. With frequent NS fluid bolus for
CVP >12 and pressors.  He had episode of NSVT on arrival while
on dopamine and was changed over to levophed, which he required
for several days of his addmision to keep MAP>65. Given
persistent hypotension concern for neurogenic shock secondary to
autonomic dysfunction, Neuro consult was obtained who did not
think that patient has autonomic dysfunction on initial
assessement.
.
#  Respiratory distress - as above, most likely secondary to
pulmonary infection complicated by pulmonary emboli. Required
significant oxygen supplementation initially but this was
reduced by 6 days of hospitalization from NRB to 40% by
facemask.
.
# PE/DVT: Hx of DVT and PE on recent hospitalization.  RL LENI
shows DVT this admission.  Given likely coumadin failure IVC
filter was placed.  Pt was started on heparin initially and then
changed over to lovenox 1mcg/kg [**Hospital1 **].  [**2-27**] AM with RUE swelling
as well, with DVT.  Heme onc consulted, started on heparin as
developing DVTs through lovenox.
- Given recurrent dvt and ?pulmonary nodules and enlarged
lymphnode concern for malignancy in setting of hypercoguble
state high.
- Currently morphine prn.
.
#. hemoptysis - likely secondary to underlying pulmonary
processes. Consider bronchoscopy only if this worsens (currently
stable).
.
#Polyuria - Unclear etiology. Continues to urinate to the point
of hypotension despite IVF being stopped. [**Month (only) 116**] have neprogenic DI
[**3-3**] ambisome. [**Month (only) 116**] also not be able to concentrate urine to
excrete all the salt he has gotten on the sepsis portocol
causing an solute diuresis. Gave dose of ddAVP to see if can
concentrate urine. Ambisome switched to caspofungin.
- Renal was consulted given concern for DI.  They did not think
that the pt has diabetes insipidus given that the patient has
had normal Uosm and Una. More likely, this is consistent with a
solute diuresis from the large amounts of fluid the patient has
received during this hospitalization. It is unclear whether he
is intravascularly depleted or overloaded, and his weight is up
approx 6kg. If he is making appropriate urine to previous IVF
administration, would expect his urine now to more accurately
match his input.  With restriction on NS IVF, pt's urine output
has improved.
.
# Infection - unclear etiology most likely source of infectionis
pulmonary, but differential in this immunocompromised patient is
very broad. ID following. So far all cultures NGTD,
cryptococcus, CMV, and histo serologies negative
- on retrovirals, azithro/bactrim
- imipenem dc'd- continuing with vanco
.
## Neuro - pt with c/o diplopia this morning which is new.  Also
with nystagmus on exam concerning for brainstem process.
- per discussion with neuro attg, given pt's likely
hypercoaguble state need to rule out stroke.
- MRI/MRA -small L cerebellar stroke, w/ sluggish basilar artery
flow, CTA also showed no thrombus but decreased basilar artery
flow.  Per Neuro ordered TTE w/ bubble, no ASD or PFO
- Daily CT showed no change (needs daily CTx7 day to assess no
hemorrhagic development
.
#Hemoptysis - likel secodary to PE and PNA. Stable in amount and
frequency. Is small amounts at this time. If decompensates of
hemoptysis progresses beyond tsp amounts will need bronchoscopy
and possible surgical consult.
.
## Neuro - pt with c/o diplopia this morning which is new.  Also
with nystagmus on exam concerning for brainstem process.
- per discussion with neuro attg, given pt's likely
hypercoaguble state need to rule out stroke.
- MRI/MRA to eval for stroke.
.
# AIDS: Initially held  HAART therapy. Restarted on [**2173-2-24**].

#. pulm nodules - concern for malignancy given fevers, LAD. o/w
infection as above. with LUL mass, discuss timing of biopsy as
differential includes lymphoma vs lung neoplasm, will need to
discuss holding anticoagulation.
.
PPx: PPI, no pneumoboots, lovenox, increase bowel regimen given
constipation, no bowel movement since admission per pt
FEN: po diet as resp status stable
Access: RIJ, R art line, PIV
Communication: sister [**Name (NI) **]
Dispo: ICU until HD stable
# Code Status: Full, discussed extensively with paitent and HCP,
[**Name (NI) **], his sister. [**Name (NI) **] is very nervous about intubation, but
agrees that he may benefit from it in the short term.
# Dispo: ICU for now given hypotension.
# Contact: [**Name (NI) **], sister  ...

The patient had a prolonged intensive care unit stay.  He
developed further progressive thromboses.  An IVC filter was
placed to prevent further pulmonary emboli.  He developed
ischemic bowel with thrombosis of celiac and mesenteric
arteries.  After extensive discussion with patient and his
sister [**Name (NI) **], the patient was made care and comfort measures
only.  He was treated with IV morphine and expired peacefully on
[**2174-3-16**].
