A 65 year-old woman with history of ESRD scheduled for LRRT
[**2155-4-8**] presenting with nausea and vomiting and emergent
induction of hemodialysis. She underwent HD without complication
and plasmapheresis to prevent transplant rejection. She received
Rituximab. Her transplant was postponed to 4/9/9 because it
seemed that she still had positive antibodies against her
daughters kidney, this however, turned out to be not
significant. She was continued on her immunosuppressant regimen
(cellcept/tacrolimus. She had an episode of fevers/chills and
was temporarily on vanc/zosyn, however, the sxs resumed and her
cultures remained negative.

On  [**2155-4-17**] she underwent living related renal transplant from
her daughter. It was noted that she had a very thin posterior
fascia and peritoneum. Therefore, the
kidney was ultimately intraperitoneal in the retroperitoneal
space. The iliac vessels were soft without significant plaque.
The donor kidney had a single renal artery with an early
bifurcation and a single renal vein and a single ureter. The
kidney pinked up and produced urine. Please refer to operative
note. Postop, she was sent to the SICU due to volume overload
and respiratory difficulty. Respiratory function improved. Urine
output was excellent.

She received plasmapheresis postop transplant for HLA
desensitization related to transplant for 3 more treatments
postop for a total of none treatments.  A total of 3 doses of
ATG were given postop op. Solumedrol was tapered. Prograf was
titrated to trough levels. Cellcept continued at 1 gram [**Hospital1 **].
Creatinine dropped to 0.6. Luminex was sent on [**4-22**]. Urine
output average 1.5 liters per day. BP was elevated to
180's/120s. Lopressor was uptitrated and Norvasc was started. BP
improved. Diet was advanced and tolerated. PT worked with her
and recommended a walker.

On postop day 4, she developed ecchymosis around incision with
extension to right hip and lower abdomen. She also started to
drain sero-sanguinous fluid from her incision.

On [**2155-4-21**], she fell in the bathroom after standing up from the
toilet striking her nose against the wall. She denied passing
out. She was alert and oriented. A stat head CT was done showing
no acute intracranial process. A sinus/[**Last Name (un) **]/max CT showed
questionable nondisplaced fracture of the nasal bone. She
developed bruising over her nose with mild-mod swelling. A
developed a frontal headache that was treated with tylenol and
iv pain medication.

She developed dizziness prompting a neurology consult on [**4-28**].
It was felt that this was not a vestibular process, but rather
findings were suggestive of cervical spondylosis with myelopathy
with dorsal column involvement, with impaired functional
position sensation given history of reduced range of motion of
the neck, upper motor neuron weakness at the deltoids, triceps,
and iliopsoas, reduced vibratory sensation, and brisk reflexes
throughout.  Recommendations were for the her to wear a soft
cervical collar at all times for two weeks (if tolerated), then
at least at nightwhile sleeping thereafter.

Around postop day 6, her abdomen appeared distended and she
complained of nausea. The incision started to oozed at the
inferior edge. This was opened at the inferior edge. She
continued to have diffuse bruising aroun the RLQ. She developed
nausea with vomiting that appeared bilious. LFTs increased (alt
144, ast 148, alk phos 296, t.bili 6.8). LFTs were monitored
daily with continued rise. Hepatitis screening was done. This
was negative for HAV, HBsAG, HCV. Hemolysis workup was negative.
Liver duplex was done twice noting a small amount of perihepatic
fluid, no intra or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation. GGT was
elevated suggestive of liver/biliary source of increased alk
phos that rose to 500 with t.bili of 4.9.

 A KUB was done showing distended loops of small bowel. An NG
tube was place. Abd CT ([**4-25**])revealed distended small bowel with
decompressed distal small bowel and relatively decompressed
colon consistent with small bowel obstruction. There was a
transition point in RLQ. There was no evidence of perforation.
Normal liver without biliary abnormalities. Small amount of
perihepatic ascites. She was kept NPO. LFTs fluctuated daily.
She received IV hydration. She started to have flatus and bowel
movements. Bowel movements increased in frequency.  On [**4-29**], the
NG tube was removed. KUB revealed persistenly dilated loops of
small bowel and air fluid levels. KUBs continued to show
distended loops with air fluid levels despite BMs.

Nausea/vomiting and diarrhea continued. The NG was replaced.
LFTs improved. On [**5-1**], she was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.
Postop diagnosis was small bowel obstruction. A wound vac was
applied to the lower portion of the incision that was opened.
Despite the vac, the wound continued to drain serous fluid. The
wound vac was discontinued and a gauze dressing was applied.
Drainage stopped and a topical dry gauze dressing was applied as
the wound healed.

She remained npo with an NG tube in place. Given prolonged npo
status, TPN was started. She developed watery diarrhea. Stool
cultures were negative. A CMV viral load was negative. Cellept
decreased to 500mg 3x/day.
Imodium was started. Diarrhea resolved. NG was removed and diet
slowly advanced and tolerated. TPN was discontinued. Ensure
supplements were tolerated tid. Imodium was discontinued.

On [**5-13**], hematocrit was 22.6. She was given 2 units of PRBC with
a hct increase to 28. She stabilized at 30.

PT recommended rehab was recommended. She was screened and
accepted at NE [**Hospital1 **]. Prograf was increased to 6mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-15**]
for a trough level of 6.4. Goal trough prograf level is 10. She
was left on prednisone 20mg qd due to high sensitivity to her
donor. She will require labs on [**5-16**] for chem 7 and a trough
prograf with results called to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**]. Labs should then be
done every Monday and Thursday.
