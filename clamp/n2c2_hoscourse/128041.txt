#. mental status/neuro exam: The patient's baseline is oriented
to place, occasionally date (usually knows [**2146**], not month). He
has bizarre/tangential speech at times, and becomes temporarily
confused. He has 5/5 strength in upper extremities, 4-/5 in
lower extremities at both proximal and distal muscles, thought
to be secondary to deconditioning and ICU myopathy (not due to
stroke). He has 2+ reflexes on right, 1+ on left. Upgoing
Babinski on right.
.
#. seizures:
The patient presented after generalized seizures, complicated by
tongue biting and hematoma. Head CT showed left-sided
intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage.   It was unknown
whether bleeding was the precipitating event, followed by
seizure due to parenchymal irritation; or, if seizure occurred
initially and trauma sustained during the convulsion led to
bleeding. The patient was loaded with Dilantin and then
initiated on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis since this does not
interact with coumadin. He had no further seizure activity int
he ICU. After transfer to the medical floor, the patient had an
episode of lower extremity shaking while asleep in a chair,
witnessed only by wife. This was thought unlikely to represent
seizure activity, and more likely myoclonic jerks during sleep.
Neurology was called to see patient at this time. 20 minute EEG
was done, showing no epileptiform activity. The patient will
continue on Keppra for at least 6 months. He will follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in neurology.
.
#. ICH:
The patient underwent a conventional angiogram which did show
2-mm aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery at the origin
of the anterior temporal branch. However, this was thought not
to be responsible for his left sylvian fissure hemorrhage as
there was no history of headache at onset and the
hemorrhage itself was located remote from the aneurysm and there
was no blood in the basal cisterns at all. He did have an
intraparenchimal bleed with a SAH component that may have been
due to amyloid angiopathy and microbleeds in GRE. These added to
his age and PV white matter disease placed him at a higher risk
for a new bleed. However, he needed to remain anticoagulated
because of his mechanical valve. Thoracic surgery was consulted
about the possibility of pursuing a valve replacement for a
biological prosthesis to avoid anticoagulation. However, the
surgical risk was determined to outweigh the benefit of avoiding
anticoagulation. The patient remained off anticoagulation due to
this high risk. On [**7-18**], the patient developed new right-sided
weakness and MRI showed new left MCA infarct. This was thought
to have originated from AVR thromboembolization. Heparin was
resumed for goal PTT 40-60 and coumadin was resumed [**8-1**]. Several
repeat head CT have all been stable, most recent [**2147-8-8**].
Heparin infusion was stopped once a therapeutic INR was reached
on warfarin.
.
#. Retroperitoneal Bleed:
After the patient had a stroke off anticoagulation, heparin was
resumed.  Shortly after, the patient developed worsening anemia
with HCT eventually falling to 19.  He received a total of 15
units pRBCs during the hospital course.  His systolic blood
pressure dropped to the 80s and he became tachycardic.  A CT
abd/pelvis revealed a large retroperitoneal hematoma.  He
required very aggressive transfusion of RBCs and underwent
evacuation of hematoma by vascular surgery on [**7-27**].  He
tolerated the procedure well and hematocrit has been stable
since the procedure.  His heparin was resumed with goal PTT
40-60 on [**7-30**] and was restarted on coumadin [**8-1**].
.
The patient was transferred to the neuromedicine step-down
service on [**8-1**].  He was noted to have intermittant fevers.  CT
of the torso and head did not reveal any new source. He became
hypotensive and Hct continued to decrease. EKG was concerning
for new T wave inversions and a stat ECHO showed possible
anterior wall motion abnormality, most likely intracranial T
waves.  The patient responded to IV fluids and placement in
trendelenberg.  This event was presumed to be due to continued
retroperitoneal bleeding. Anticoagulation was again held
temporarily.
The patient was eventually safely anticoagulated and INR was 3.0
on day of discharge. The patient's coumadin was being held for
supratherapeutic INR prior to discharge. PT and PTT are
elevated, likely due to poor nutritional status. INR will need
to be monitored daily and coumadin adjusted appropriately to
maintain goal range 2.5-3.5.  He should have daily INR checks
and adjustment of dose to maintain INR 2.5-3.5.  At the time of
discharge, he was restarted on coumadin 4.0 mg daily.
His hematocrit is currently 27.9 and stable.

#. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to a large
tongue hematoma.  On [**7-24**] (after extubation) he was found to
have increased respiration rate and work of breathing.  He had a
clot removed from his trachea by ENT with moderate resolution of
symptoms.  He is currently doing well on room air.

#. Ventilator-associated PNA: The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
also complicated by persistent fevers and leukocytosis secondary
to pneumonia while intubated. He underwent 2 bronchoscopies with
BAL and samples grew klebsiella, serratia, and staph aureus.  He
completed a 12-day course of antibiotics, initially started on
vancomycin and cefepime.  He is currently afebrile with no
leukocytosis.

#. Gout: The patient developed erythema, swelling and pain of
the left 1st MTP joint, consistent with gout. He has a prior
history of gout, so no joint aspiration was done. The patient
responded well to colchicine with reduced pain and inflammation.

#. Left knee trauma: The patient fell from bed in MICU. X-ray
showed possible small nondisplaced tibial fracture, but unable
to see joint line. The patient was weight bearing well with PT.

#. HTN: The patient was continued on metoprolol and Imdur.

#. Code status: DNR

*** Please perform daily INR checks to adjust warfarin dose to
maintain INR between 2.5-3.5***
