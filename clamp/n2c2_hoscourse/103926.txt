85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease s/p
BMS x 2 in RCA on [**2167-4-10**], with post-cath course complicated by
pulmonary edema, contrast-induced nephropathy requiring CCU stay
with transition to cardiac service.

1) Unstable angina/CAD: Patient's typical anginal pain was
occurring at rest and had ST depressions in V4-6. Given concern
for ongoing bleeding cath was deferred until [**4-10**]. Cardiac
catheterization demonstrated 90% occlusion of ostial RCA which
was stented with two overlapping bare metal stents. Her chest
pain occurred intermittently since the PCI with intermittent ST
depressions in V4-V6. Nitro gtt was temporarily started for the
pain, and she remained pain free after it was discontinued.
Cardiac markers were mildly elevated, likely demand ischemia
from anemia, and CK-MB was negative. She was treated with
aspirin, statin, and plavix. Patient's metoprolol was restarted
once she stabilized.

2) Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Felt to be
secondary to RBC transfusions at OSH. She had an ongoing O2
requirement and desatted to 85% RA on am of [**4-11**], for which she
was transferred to the CCU and lasix gtt was started. Fluid was
initially removed via CVVH (as below), although once UOP
improved, she was successfully diuresed with IV furosemide.

3) Acute on chronic CKD: FENa 6%, likely contrast nephropathy.
Her [**Last Name (un) **] was held. Renal was consulted for poor UOP while on
lasix drip and high dose diuril. Her creatinine rose and she was
started on CVVH via L IJ line. After a few days, her UOP picked
up and responded well to 40mg IV furosemide boluses, so the CVVH
line was removed.

4) Anemia: Given concern for RP bleed related to cath, she had
CT abd, which showed bilat ?hemothoraces, but no RP bleed. Other
source could be GI bleed from external hemorrhoids. She received
1 unit of pRBCs and her hematocrit remained stable.

5) Pneumonia: Patient had frequent coughing associated with
desaturations. CT chest was concerning for atypical pneumonia
vs. alveolar hemorrhage, although pulm consult favored the
former. ANCA and anti-GBM were negative. She received a 5 day
course of azithromycin and a brief course of prednisone for
possible diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (one day each at 60mg,
40mg, 20mg, 10mg). Her cough greatly improved.

6) Diabetes mellitus: Initially on glargine, although changed to
insulin gtt in the CCU due to highly elevated (300s) sugars in
the setting of steroids. She was transitioned back to glargine
as the steroids were rapidly tapered.
