Summary: 74 yo M transferred from NWH with EKG changes, trop
here to 0.87 (baseline 0.2) and RLE cellulitis, right foot
osteomyelitis, worsening acute on chronic renal failure

# Right lower extremity cellulitis and right foot osteomyelitis:
The patient presented with right lower extremity cellulitis and
was found to have osteomyelitis in the right foot. Vascular
surgery evaluated the patient and thought that treatment for the
infection and ischemia would be a below the knee amputation,
though given the patient's poor cardiac status, he would not be
a good candidate for surgery. The patient was empirically
started on Vancomycin and Zosyn. A wound culture grew Klebsiella
oxytoca and MRSA and continued on those antibiotics. Since
vascular surgery would be high risk, podiatry was consulted for
local debridement. They debrided the area locally, yet erythema
of the right foot existed. It remained unclear whether the
erythema was due to ischemia vs. a subcutaneous abscess, so they
recommended a MRI of the foot. The MRI was never performed
because after discussion with the family and primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was decided for the patient to become CMO. His
antibiotics were withdrawn and wound care applied to the area.

# Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient presented with a
creatinine close to his baseline, however, after periods of
hypotension, likely due to a peri-septic state, his creatinine
starting to rise. He was given fluid boluses of 500 cc of normal
saline as needed because his urine lytes showed a FeUrea~20-25%.
Renal was consulted and thought his creatinine rise was likely
due to acute tubular necrosis secondary to a pre-renal state.
The patient was offered aluminium hydroxide for high phosphate
levels, but the patient refused it. A renal ultrasound showed no
hydronephrosis. The patient became progressively oliguric with
UOP less than 20 cc/hour. Renal thought his kidneys would
unlikely recover (his creatinine rose to 5.3 despite
interventions). The patient and his family felt that they did
not want to pursue dialysis as an option.

#Increased troponins: The patient was noted to have high
troponins and excentuated ST wave depressions in V3-V5.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended medical management with
a beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, statin, and aspirin. The patient
was started on these medications, though became persistently
hyperkalemic, and therefore, the ACEi was discontinued. Also,
his CK and LFTs were [**Last Name (LF) 28645**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the statin dose of 80 mg was
lowered to 20 mg and eventually discontinued due to persistently
[**First Name3 (LF) 28645**] LFTs. An echocardiogram revealed no acute wall motion
abnormality, though it did show worsening tricuspid
regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery pressure.
Throughout his stay, the patient did not have any chest pain.

#Increased LFTs: The patient has a known history of alcohol
abuse and increased LFTs in the past. During his peri-septic
period, the patient was noted to have increased LFTs, likely
multifactorial due to low perfusion to the liver and also
congestion secondary to tricuspid regurgitation. The patient did
not have any complaints of abdominal pain, though, he had
hepatomegaly on exam.

#Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of a GI bleed
and was guiaic positive in the ER. In addition, he had a
persistently elevated PT/PTT, likely due to either underlying
liver or hematologic disease. The patient's hematocrit remained
stable until [**9-26**] when his hematocrit dropped from 29.0 to 25.6
and was noted to have melenic stools. He continued to have
melenic stools, so he was transfused one unit of blood and
transferred to the MICU. His aspirin was discontinued. His
hematocrit remained stable in the MICU and transferred to the
floors where there were no signs of any GI bleeding.
