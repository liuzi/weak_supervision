38 year old male with history of cerebral palsy, ulcerative
colitis, previous aspiration pneumonias, here with influenza,
aspiration pneumonia, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

***FOLLOWUP:
1. Cdiff toxin B pending. Cdiff x2 negative on stool culture.
Was treated with 10 day course of Flagyl IV during admission,
and diarrhea did not change in frequency or quantity.

# Influenza/aspiration pneumonia:
The patient presented with nausea and vomiting from influenza,
and likely aspirated during this admission in this setting. On
[**3-28**], he had an aspiration event and hypoxemia, and CXR showed
LLL infiltrate from aspiration pneumonia. He was treated with
Clindamycin and Levofloxacin, but he developed diarrhea. The
patient has a history of colitis with Ciprofloxacin in the past
per his mother, and Levofloxacin was stopped on [**4-1**], and
Azithromycin was started. On [**4-1**], the patient developed stridor
and worsening O2 saturation to the low 80s with minimal
improvement on NRB. Although ENT found no airway edema,
obstruction or tracheomalacia, the patient's respiratory status
continued to worsen and he was transferred to the MICU and
intubated.

He remained intubated for two days, on aztreonam and vancomycin
(both started [**4-1**]). His weaning was complicated by agitation
and tachycardia, which improved as lines/tubes were minimized.
He was extubated successfully 2 days prior to transfer to the
floor.

# Diarrhea:
On [**3-31**], the patient spiked a new fever and developed
antibiotic-associated diarrhea. His diarrhea continued, despite
being maintained on flagyl x 6 days and cdiff negative x 2.
Cdiff toxin B was still pending on the day of discharge.

# Dystonic reaction to Haldol:
When he arrived to the floor after being in the MICU, he
developed dystonia and partially fixing of his head turned to
the left side, tongue thrusting movements, toe curling, arm and
wrist bending. He had been given haldol 2.5 IV daily because he
had been very agitated in the MICU. When he clinically improved,
his signs did not change. He responded well to Benadryl 50 IV
and Ativan 1 IV TID prn, with relief of dystonia within minutes.
Benztropine was never given because of concern of exacerbating
sinus tachycardia with HR 100-105 due to infection.

# Sinus tachycardia:
His baseline HR is 80s per his mother, who is very involved in
his care. His HR was consistently 100-105 during admission,
despite fluid repletion and running of tube feeds and water
flushes at home rate for 3 days before discharge. His HR should
be rechecked as an outpatient, discussed with his mother. His
mother stated that she was cancelling the patient's appointment
with GI tomorrow because the patient greatly wanted to be home
and away from hospitals, but she lives near a pediatrician
friend who agreed to check the patient's vitals at his house
this week. VNA was offered to the patient's mother and family,
but they agreed to have the pediatrician see the patient in 3
days after discharge.

# Seizure Disorder:
The patient was continued on Phenobarbital, level was
therapeutic during admission.

# Cerebral Palsy:
The patient was continued on Valium QHS for spasms.

# Ulcerative Colitis:
He was continued on Asacol per outpatient regimen.

# GERD:
He was continued on home regimen of PPI and H2-Blocker.
