#Hemoptysis:
The patient presented with hemoptysis and had an episode of
epistaxis while in the ER. A CT of the chest revealed
non-specific multi-focal ground glass opacities, particularly in
the right lung, and bronchial wall thickening with occlusion of
several airway segments to the right upper and middle lobes.
The patient was observed in the ICU because of the large volume
hemoptysis.  He underwent a bronchoscopy by interventional
pulmonology, but they were unable to visualize the source of the
bleeding because of the large amount of blood in the right upper
lobe. He underwent IR angiography, but they were not able to
visualize the vessel because it was not actively bleeding. The
patient was transferred to the general medical floor
post-procedure where he continued to have small volume
hemoptysis.  Interventional radiology repeated the angiography
but was unable to embolize an artery because there was no active
bleed.  The patient underwent a second bronchoscopy on [**2174-9-26**],
where a clot was found to be nearly occluding the right upper
lobe; the clot was not removed for concern of re-activating the
original bleed.  [**Doctor First Name **], ANCAs, anti-GBM AB, HIV Ab, and PPD were
negative.  His plavix was held since admission, and his
hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s after an initial drop
from Hct 42 in the ED.  The patient did not require any blood
transfusions.  He did get one unit of platelets transfused, per
surgical recommendations, to provide him with more functional
platelets in the setting of recent Plavix use.

The patient was seen and evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of Thoracic
Surgery who felt that the risk of Right upper lobectomy was
higher than the risk of significant re-bleeding at this time. No
tumors or cavitary lesions were noted on the CT scan from
admission.  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient in two weeks after re-imaging by CT.

#Coronary artery disease:
The patient is s/p 3 vessel CABG in [**2170**] and 2 drug eluting
stents placed in [**2169**].  His plavix was discontinued because his
stents were placed about four years ago.  Upon discharge, he was
started on Aspirin 81mg every other day, per recommendation of
his outpatient cardiologist.  The patient was continued on his
home dose of simvastatin.
.
#Hypertension:
His blood pressure medication was held in the inpatient setting
in order to more effectively monitor his hemodynamic status.
His home dose of valsartan was restarted upon discharge from the
hospital.
.
#Emphysematous changes in lungs:
Emphysematous changes were noted in the patient's lungs on Chest
CT. The patient does have a 20-30 pack-year smoking history,
though he quit smoking one month ago.  He did have Pulmonary
Function Testing done prior to discharge to make sure he could
tolerate a lobectomy.

The patient was continued on him home medications for thyroid
hormone replacement and psoriasis.
