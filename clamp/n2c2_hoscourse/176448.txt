SEIZURES:
On initial EEG, he was thought to be in complex partial status,
and was
given a trial of ativan with electrographic and clinical
improvement. He was increased on his Keppra from 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] to
1500 mg [**Hospital1 **]. He continued to have frequent R temporal
complex partial seizures, characterized by focal rhythmic theta
activity.  Clinically, the seizures were characterized by L hand
twitching movements, R facial twitching, and confusion.
On [**5-29**], He was loaded on phosphenytoin and started on
maintenance
dosing with improvement in seizure frequency.  On [**6-1**], he was
loaded on vimpat 200 mg IV, and started on maintenance of 100 mg
[**Hospital1 **].

Patient had a very complicated course with many antiepileptic
medications trialed.

He was initially transferred to the ICU for hypotension and
respiratory distress.
His seizures were controlled with midazolam, then he was
switched to propofol because midazolam was not providing
sufficient sedation, and this was also effective in suppressing
seizures. He then began having frequent nonconvulsive seizures,
and was started on phenobarbital [**6-6**], and Depakote on [**6-9**]. He
underwent trach and PEG [**6-11**]. Zonisamide and Topamax were also
tried. He temporarily was able to be transferred to the
neurology step down unit, but returned to the ICU for midazolam
drip on [**2190-7-4**].

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus remained refractory.  The
seizures continued to originate from bilateral temporal lobes
despite increasing serum levels of Dilantin (corrected 20-25)
and phenobarbital (90-100) and midazolam drip.
