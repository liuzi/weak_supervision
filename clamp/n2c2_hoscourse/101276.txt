61 y/o male with metastatic rectal ca diagnosed [**3-26**] s/p xrt
(last [**6-25**]) and chemo (last [**2120-9-25**]) who was admitted with
diarrhea, fever, and neutropenia who developed hypoxemia, lactic
acidosis, and confusion.  Since his admission, the patient's
diarrhea and fevers had progressively improved on cefepime,
vancomycin, and metronidazole as well as Lomotil.  Since then
his course has been complicated by a steadily declining
hematocrit (33 to 25 over the admission), worsening
thrombocytopenia, and a new coagulopathy (INR up to 5.4).  On
[**10-12**], he was noted to be hypoxemic and had chest x-ray showing
only a distended stomach and a CTA with no PE (but also a
distended stomach and known liver mets).  ABG was 7.44/25/63
then 7.32/21/84 that afternoon.  His oxygen requirement waxed
and waned, from mid 80's on room air to mid 90's on room air.
His hypoxemia persisted and the patient became increasingly
tired, confused, and tachypneic.  A repeat ABG was 7.3/19/75 but
his lactate had climbed from 3.5 to 8.0. He was transferred to
the ICU at which time he was fatigued and appeared disoriented.
In this setting, he denied pain (including abdominal) as well as
dyspnea despite obvious tachypnea and mild accessory muscle use.
He was started on IVF with 3 amps bicarb, lactate trended down,
acidosis resolving. CT abdomen showed SBO with no obvious cut
off for obstruction a NGT placed and medical management
recommeneded by surgery. Primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
continued to follow.
  In the ICU he was found to have guiaic positive NGT
secretions.  He was transfused PRBCs for a dropping HCT.  In
addition he was noted to have an elevated INR for which he was
treated with FFP.  He was evaluated by surgery who felt him to
be a poor surgical candidate.  For his confusion a CT of his
head was performed which was negative for bleed or other change.
 His hypoxia resolved and was felt to be due to aspiration
initially.  He was treated with TPN given his poor nutritional
status.  He was treated with octroetide per surgery recs with no
improvement.  On [**2120-10-18**] a family meeting was held at which
time it was decided that the goal of care was maximal comfort.
At that meeting it was decided to continue with fluids and
analgesia but to limit other medications and TPN.  The family
will provide Chinese herbs and prayer.
.
# GI: Diarrhea was believed to be chemo-induced diarrhea.  The
patient was covered with cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl given
neutropenic fever.  The CT of abdomen on admission did not show
any inflammatory processes in the abdomen. The patient was given
supportive care with IVF and Lomotil once obtained stool samples
for cultures which were negative and his diarrhea improved with
lomotil.  However, patient became acidotic and CT abdomen was
repeated and revealed SBO. NGT was placed and surgey was
consulted but did not feel that the patient was a good surgical
candidate. Patient was continued on medical management.
Octreotide was added to his regimen to help to relieve
obstruction. His lactate continued to trend down and NGT outout
began to slow. Patient denied any abdominal pain.
    However, while in the ICU he developed bloody stools in the
setting of coagulopathy. This was felt to be likely secondary to
his rectal cancer. He was tranfused pRBCs and FFP. After several
bloody stools and rectal tube placement his bloody bowel
movements slowed, his coags improved and his hematocrit was
stable.
.
Coagulopathy: Likely DIC secondary to cancer. He devloped GI
bleed as mentioned above and was transfused several units of FFP
and pRBCs and 1 unit of platelets. By tranfer from the ICU his
HCT and INR was stable but platelets were 34. The patient and
family did not want any further transfusions as their goal was
comfort and this would require daily monitoring of his CBC and
coags.
.
# NEUTROPENIC FEVER: The patient was started on cefepime, vanco,
and flagyl on admission. He had some fevers early in his
hospitalization but remained afebrile for the rest of his
admission. He because hypoxic and acidotic and a CT chest was
otained which revealed likely aspiration/pneumonia. He was
continue on his antibiotics to complete a 14 day course and
received daily neupogen injections. By the 11th day of his
antibiotic course he was no longer neutropenic. His neupogen was
discontinued and he remained afebrile.

# AG METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: concerning for lactic acidosis [**1-24**] to
hypovolemia.  Patient refused central line/sepsis protocol in
ED. He was  hemodynamically stable on transfer to the floor.
Lactate normalized after IVF. Then the patient continued to have
non-anion gap acidosis [**1-24**] to diarrhea.  ABG was obtained and
the patient appropriately compensated with decreased CO2 (25)
with normal pH 7.4-7.44. He then became more hypoxic and acidotc
and was tranferred to the ICU. In the ICU it was discoved that
he had an extremely dilated stomach and SBO. It was felt that
the lactic acidosis ,may have been secondary to the extreme
distension of his stomach given the rapid decline in his lactate
on decompression with NGT. His gap closed and his lactate
conitnued to tened down.
.
# RECTAL CANCER: Last chemotherapy was last avastin/5FU on [**9-25**].
Given that he did not tolerate this well, no further
chemotherapy was planned. He also developed what is believed to
be lower GI bleed, SBO and DIC during admission all which were
thaough to be related to his metastatic disease. Due to his poor
prognosis and worsening medical condition a family meeting was
held and the family and patient agreed that comfort was the most
important goal at this point. He was continued on IVF and the
NGGT was kept in place to prevent worsening pain from his SBO.
It was decided that no further blood products would be given.
.
FEN: Patient was actively hydrated in the setting of diarrhea
and acidosis. He was continued on IVF given his SBO. Given his
poor prognosis and that comfort was the goal, he was not started
on TPN, but rather hydrated with IVF in the setting of SBO.
