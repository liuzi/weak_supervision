1.  Derm:  Over the course of patient's stay on [**Company 191**] Firm,
patient had rigors and fevers of up to 101 degree.  The
patient was initially continued on Tegretol.  The patient had
worsening rash throughout his torso with lip swelling and
tongue swelling.  The patient did not experience any
respiratory difficulties throughout the course of his stay on
the [**Company 191**] service.  A derm consult was obtained.  The
dermatology team recommended discontinuing Tegretol.  Their
thought was that the patient's symptoms were secondary to his
hypersensitivity to Dilantin.  The patient was treated
symptomatically with IV fluids, Zantac, Benadryl and Synalar
cream.  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit overnight for observation given risk of respiratory
distress.  [**Hospital **] Medical Intensive Care Unit stay was
uneventful.  Skin biopsy was also consistent with
hypersensitivity reaction.  Over the course of patient's stay
in the hospital, patient's rash started to improve with
decreasing erythema and edema.

2.  Neuro:  Patient was seen by neurology service.  They
recommended stopping all anti-epileptic medications since
they thought that his symptoms were likely secondary to
carotid reperfusion syndrome and anti-seizure medications are
not necessarily beneficial under these circumstances.

3.  GI:  Patient's LFTs were slightly elevated during his
admission.  The patient's Lipitor was held due to increased
LFTs.  His increased LFTs were likely secondary to Dilantin.
Patient to follow-up with his PCP to make sure LFTs are
trending down and before restarting Lipitor.
