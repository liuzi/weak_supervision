Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to the ED with a chief complaint of hemoptysis

# Hemoptysis - Chest film demonstrated multifocal opacities in
the RUL and RLL. Given the patient's prior history of TB and the
inability to exclude this on presentation, he was admitted to a
negative-pressure room.  On the floor, he remained
hemodynamically stable. He had three negative AFBs and was
removed from respiratory precautions. He had a CT scan on [**7-28**]
which showed peribronchovascular opacities and a 1cm x 2cm right
lung nodule felt to be chronic granuloma/prior infection
sequelae vs. malignancy. On [**7-29**], he again had moderate
hemoptysis and reportedly vomited blood and had black stools.
Pulmonary was consulted, and he was started on
Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin empirically for CAP on [**2193-7-31**].

Durnig his course, he had a recurrence of massive hemoptysis.
He was bronched on [**8-1**] and found to have substantial bleeding
from the posterior segment of right upper lobe. He then went to
IR and had embolization of the right bronchial artery and right
upper intercostal arterial branch. After the procedure, he was
intubated with a dual-lumen endotracheal tube to prevent
extravasation of blood into the left lung if bleeding recurred.
He remained stable and was extubated on [**8-2**]. Ceftriaxone was
replaced with Cefpodoxime on [**8-3**]. His pulmonary hemorrhage was
attributed to inflammation of prior eroded tissue from old TB,
with a new pneumonia as the precipitant.

# Elevated creatinine - He also had mild renal insufficiency
which was likely secondary to contrast nephropathy after the IR
procedure. The patient was transferred to the medical floor on
[**2193-8-3**], and his creatinine normalized with IV fluids and time.

He demonstrated continued clinical improvement, with small
amount of hemoptysis post-procedure.  He remained afebrile with
normal vital signs after transfer from the ICU.  He was
discharged on [**2193-8-4**] and will complete a 7 day course of both
azithromycin and cefpodoxime, to be completed on [**2193-8-6**].  He
will schedule a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] the week of discharge.

No other medications were started.

The patient is a full code.
