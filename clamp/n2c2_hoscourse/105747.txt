This 59 year old patient with a PMH of DMII, HTN, ? MI ([**2135**])and
history of recurrent Atrial Fibrillation/ Atrial flutter
referred for elective Atrial flutter ablation on [**2142-10-12**], now
admitted to the CCU for management of his hypotension during
ablation requiring pressors.
.
# Rhythm: He was admitted for elective ablation.  The procedure
went well from a rhythm standpoint and his atrial flutter
converted to NSR.
.
In the CCU, he was monitorred on telemetry overnight and
remained in NSR.  Metoprolol was decreased to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]. [**Doctor Last Name **] of
Hearts monitorring was arranged prior to discharge, and he was
instructed to follow up with his cardiologist in 5 days.
.
The patient was therapeutically anticoagulated upon admission
and will continue his outpatient dose of warfarin with INR
monitorring upon discharge.
.
# Hypotension: Patient chronically hypertensive. Baseline SBP
160s-180s. During the procedure, initial BP was 168/109
(baseline). He got etomidate and succinylcholine for intubation,
followed by fentanyl and midazolam.  Immediately after reversion
to NSR, patient became hypotensive to 70/50. Stat echo showed
mildly depressed EF without signs of tamponade. He was started
on phenylephrine briefly which was quickly weaned. He was
extubated without difficulty and transferred to the CCU.  He had
no further episodes of hypotension.  In the CCU BPs were
100-140s systolic.  His home ACEI and metoprolol were restarted.

# Coronaries: Patient experienced a questionable MI in [**2135**] for
which he was cath and demonstrated 50% occlusion of an unknown
vessel.  Given that history, ASA was started.  He will discuss
whether it is appropriate to continue this with his
cardiologist.  ACEI and beta blocker were continued.  He was
noted to have been unable to tolerate statins secondary to
myalgias.
.
# Pump: Unknown EF.  Apparently euvolemic.  Lasix was continued
at home dose.
.
# Type II DM: Last HBA1C was 8.3%.  FS were initially 200s-300s
immediatley after procedure but well controlled subsequently.
Home insulin pump regimen was continued.
.
# Asthma:  No active disease.  Advair was continued
