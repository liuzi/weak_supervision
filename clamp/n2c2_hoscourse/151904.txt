46 yo man with history of cervical spinal cord injury, s/p C3-6
ACDF and remaining quadriplegia, indwelling suprapubic
catheter/recurrent UTIs, baclofen pump, COPD, OSA who presented
to OSH with after his wife noted seizure like activity with
subsequent unresponsiveness, s/p 1 day intubation.  Admission
complicated by hypotension, bradycardia, hypoventillation.
.
# Hypotension, bradycardia, hypopnea:  Patient presented
hypotensive to SBP high 70-80 without reflex tachycardia (HRs as
low as 40s).  Hypotension was not responsive to extensive volume
challenge (given 7.5 L NS in 24 hours).  The etiology appears to
be a combination of increased vagal tone and medication effect.
The HR and BP responded to atropine challenge, indicating
increased vagal tone from some offending process.  Started on
scopalomine patch.  He was later also started on midodrine for
further pressure support.  The etiology of the increased vagal
tone was most likely related to the UTI.  The other major
factors contributing was probably excess benzodiazepine and
opioid. He had pinpoint pupils when he first came in.  On his
home doses of medications the patient had a low respiratory
rate, and retained CO2 on ABG.  The chronic hypopnea may lead to
increased bradycardia.  The patient's diazepam and methadone
doses were decreased as below.
.
# Complicated UTI (enterococcus and serratia): Patient presented
with foul smelling urine which is consistent with prior UTIs. He
never had a fever, but he may have been unable to mount fever
due to level of spinal cord lesion. Patient was initially on
broad spectrum antibiotics but was narrowed based upon OSH
culture data.  Following 4 days of IV antibiotics, the patient
was narrowed to PO amoxicillin for enterococcus plus cipro for
serratia. Will receive a total of 14 days of abx for complicated
UTI.  Last dose of Abx to be given on [**2136-5-31**].
.
# Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy.  The patient was admitted
following sustained altered mental status after an episode of
clonic movements, thought by wife to represent seizure activity.
 Resolved per wife on admission to the ICU, but patient
continued to be sedated with flat affect.  Now much improved
once decreased opiates, likely medication effect, as well as
encephalopathy related to the UTI.  Methadone dose was
decreased. Diazepam dose was decreased. EEG was negative for
seizure activity. Unclear if patient actually had seizure
leading up to original presentation but no evidence during this
hospitalization. More likely patient had toxic/metabolic
derangements described above. Of note, the patient's wife was
very concerned that the movements she saw (eyes rolling back in
head, patient becoming confused) had happened a previous time
when the patient received cymbalta. Cymbalta was stopped.
.
# ? Syringx: Patient had been recently diagnosed with cervical
syringx per OSH records. However repeat MRI here did not show
syringx but did show diffuse cervical spinal cord atrophy with
cystic myelomalacia at C4-5 at the site of prior contusion. This
was conveyed to one of the patient's primary neurologists, Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 27598**].
.
# COPD.  On albuterol at home.  Chronically retaining CO2.
Decreased diazepam and methadone to increase respiratory drive.
Continue albuterol PRN.
.
# DVT.  After discussion with patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 61384**], it does
not appear that any documentation of DVT exists. The patient had
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] IVC filter placed at the time of his spinal cord
injury, and has been on anticoagulation since then. Current
recommendations are that patients with IVF filters be
anticoagulated if there are no contraindications (since IVC
thrombi can develop). Given absence of contraindications, the
patient's coumadin was continued.
.
# OSA:  Patient has previous diagnosis of OSA however he has
declined CPAP at home and here due to discomfort.  Nasal cannula
at night to maintain O2 sats

# Chronic PAIN:  Pain medications decreased, as above, for
respiratory suppression and sedation.  Patient remained with
controlled pain on decreased methadone to 10mg qid.  Patient
also started on lidocaine patch.
