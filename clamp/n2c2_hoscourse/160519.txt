REASON FOR ICU ADMISSION:
Pt is a 69 y.o male with h.o CAD s/p CABG complicated by
restenosis requiring multiple stents and recent NSTEMI,
mechanical aortic valve on coumadin, recurrent GI bleeds and
IDDM who was transferred from OSH with melena and CTA showing
active bleeding in proximal ileum.
.
#upper GI bleed/acute blood loss/anemia-CTA per OSH report
showed active bleeding in the proximal ileum. Pt with recent EGD
with non-bleeding gastritis. Last colonoscopy 1 yr ago with
polyps. UGIB in the setting of restarting plavix 1 week ago for
NSTEMI. PT also on couamdin for mechanical valve, and started on
heparin ggt as coumadin was held in setting of procedure. Hct
remained stable. Pt was placed on a protonix gtt. Plavix was
continued up until transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], then restarted. Discussed
anticoagulation with patient's cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 32772**] who felt
as though pt should be on heparin gtt as long as deemed safe
from GI procedure prospective. Would prefer to restart ASAP
after any procedure. In addition, outpt cardiologist felt as
though pt should be on plavix unless there is presence of
hemodynamically significant GI bleeding. He agreed that pt does
not tolerate dual anti-platelet therapy (per pt, ASA caused
bleeding). Enteroscopy was performed at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2156-4-29**] which
showed no evidence of bleeding via approach from above. Small
bowel enteroscopy/colonoscopy was performed [**2156-4-30**] which was
similarly unremarkable. Pt was restarted on warfarin and heparin
gtt. Pt went home [**2156-5-1**] on lovenox as bridge, with INR checks
planned for [**2156-5-3**] and [**2156-5-5**].
.
#CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: s/p CABG and PCI x2, severe CAD with
chronic angina medically managed. Recent NSTEMI with decision to
restart plavix after being held x2 years due to recurrent GI
bleeds. At [**Hospital1 18**] plavix was held initially as GI team was
uncomfortable doing procedure on plavix as interventions for
bleeding (ex. clipping, cauterization could lead to more
bleeding while on plavix). In addition, it was felt that at the
time plavix effects would still be in his system as there was no
complete washout period. As above, discussed case with pt's
outpatient cardiologist who felt that pt would need to remain on
plavix unless life hemodynamically significant GI bleeding. Pt
was continued on imdur, statin, beta blocker held, see
bradycardia below. He was ruled out for MI at OSH prior to
transfer. He was monitored on tele. Without events.
.
# MECHANICAL AORTIC VALVE: placed at St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**]. Patient's goal
INR 3.5 for  mechanical valve. Was switched to heparin which was
stopped 6 hours prior to procedures. Given significant risk of
thrombosis, heparin was restarted after procedures, despite
patient's known GI bleed. HCT was monitored closely and remained
stable. Heparin gtt was changed to lovenox on discharge, see
above.
.
# Bradycardia: Patient noted to be bradycardic after procedure.
Thought to be related to sedation for procedure. Improved as the
patient woke up from sedation. Still, HR remained in the 50-60
range throughout hospitalization. Initially home beta blocker
was held. Pt was monitored on telemetry without events. He was
asymptomatic. Home atenolol restarted on discharge.
.
#DIABETES MELLITUS - type 2, with complications, peripheral
neuropathy.  Placed on conservative insulin regimen while NPO.
Pt resumed meformin and glyburide upon discharge. Continued
gabapentin for neuropathy.
.
#HYPERTENSION - benign; initially held beta blocker in setting
of bradycardia. Continued imdur. Held lisinopril while NPO. On
the morning of discharge his blood pressure was elevated in the
170s systolic. We then restarted his home medications (atenolol,
lisinopril) which we had been holding and felt these would be
adequate for blood pressure control.
.
#DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE - chronic, but with recent acute
exacerbation. Lasix was held while pt was NPO, and also was
given with 1u pRBCs.
.
#hypothyroidism-continued synthroid
.
#HL-continued simvastatin
.
#GERD-on PPI ggt for c/f GI bleed as above, transitioned to PO
PPI on discharge
.
#leukopenia/thrombocytopenia-unclear etiology. Could be due to
acute process. Thrombocytopenia could be consumptive. PLT count
was monitored closely and remained stable.
.
Pt was maintained as FULL CODE throughout the course of this
hospitalization.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
anticoagulation: pt sent home on warfarin (subtherapeutic after
holding for procedures) and lovenox. He will need INR checked
Monday [**2156-5-3**] and Wednesday [**2156-5-5**] likely to DC lovenox [**2156-5-5**]
as ideally he would have a 48 hour therapeutic overlap. Pt was
instructed to follow up with PCP regarding this issue.
