In brief this is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD who presented with
asystolic cardiac arrest.

# Asystolic arrest: Most likely respiratory arrest. Initially
started on cooling protocol but this was stopped for elevated
INR. Since admission he remained nonresponsive with fixed and
dilated pupils. He was intubated and remained so for the
duration of the hospitalization. Daily spontaneous breathing
trials were negative. Trach was placed and his care was
transitioned to a ventilatory rehab facitlity.

# Hypotension: he was noted to be hypotensive in the ED and was
given IVF and started on pressor support with norepinephrine. He
was waned of this medication and was able to mantain his BP. An
ECHO was obtained showing EF20% hypokinetic LV and PCWP
elevated. This is suggestive of systolic sysfunction and suggest
a cardiac etiology of hypotension. He was gradually weaned off
pressors and maintained a normal BP (90-120 systolic) for
several days. His tamsulosin was held.

# Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and recent
antibiotic use. No evidence of DIC. This was reversed with
vitamin K and FFP. He was then placed on hep gtt when his inr
was subtherapeutic. After the trach and peg he was restarted on
coumadin. He will be bridged back onto coumadin at the
ventilatory rehab center in [**1-3**] days. Goal INR 2.5-3.5.

# h/o [**Date Range 1291**]: on heparin ggt for thrombus ppx. Transition to
warfarin with heparin bridge for 2 days at INR>2.5.

# Neurological disturbances: As noted he was unrespionsive to
verbal and painfull comands. Initially his pupils were fixed and
dilated. He was placed on EEG and a head CT showed small vessel
ischemic disease and global parenchymal atrophy. No evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute large vascular
territorial infarction. His EEG identified foci of seizure
activity, which occurred with concurrent uncontrolled muscle
movement suggesting a seizure. Neurology followed the paitent.
He was started on Keppra and this was uptitrated to effect (i.e
absence of seizure activity on exam and EEG). During his stay he
exbited some change in neuro exam, in that he was minimally
responsive to pain and pupils more reactive. However this was
very short lasted (one day) and subsequently he was again
nonresponsive.

# Acute renal failure: Initially he was noted to have an
elevated creatinine of 2.1 from 1.o in recent months. Also this
was associated with oligouria. This improved with pressure
support and diuresis, suggestive that the renal failure was
related to decreased forward cardiac output.

# Longitudinal care: Palliative care consult obtained and
several meettings were held with family members and spiritual
leader. Decision to mantain ventilatory support unless evidence
of worsening multiple organ failure.

# Foot Ulceration: Noted severe ulcers on right foot, consistent
with prior documented note by vascular surgery (tendons
exposed). Continued wound care.

# Nutritional support: provided through tube feeds during his
hospitalization. PEG tube placed for future support.

# Complicated UTI: on cefpodoxime (h/o proteus and enterococcus
in urine sensitive to CTX - not cipro). End date [**2108-3-11**].

# Access: PICC was placed for administration of IV medications.


# Indwelling devices: Trach, PEG, PICC
