episode of syncope and seizure. OSH CT revealed a brain mass
with vasogenic edema. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where a
Head CT was repeated- again showing a  two rim-enhancing lesions
peripherally located within the right frontal lobe with
associated vasogenic edema and mass effect.  Pt was admitted to
the ICU under Dr.[**Name (NI) 9034**] care. A Brain MRI was done on

consistent with metastases with surrounding vasogenic edema and
right frontal sulcal effacement

lesion or mets, but did show ground glass opacity in RUL.
