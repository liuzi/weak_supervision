83yo male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for
evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large
pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid
collections thought related to his pseudocyst. His course was
complicated by unexplained PEA arrest. The patient had an ICU
course s/p resuscitation wherein he did not regain mental
faculties or responsiveness. His family chose comfort measures
and Mr. [**Known lastname 59996**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2166-5-19**].

# PEA arrest - unclear precipitant. Patient never regained
mental faculties.

1. Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
Collections
On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect,
suggestive of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS
which revealed a large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was
also performed, which confirmed the large pseudocysts but also
noted multiple large abdominal fluid collections. He was
evaluated by our general surgery team, who thought his abdominal
process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation was
relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage
at this time was not indicated. He developed a bleeding GDA
aneurysm and was taken to IR for embolization before which he
developed PEA arrest. This GDA was ultimately embolized.

2. Clostridium difficile infection
Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased
diarrhea and marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff
positive and started on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his
diarrhea. He was recommended to continue flagyl for 2 weeks from
4/7-20/10.

3. Hepatic Cirrhosis
Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis,
although patient has no history of this in the past.

4. Atrial Fibrillation
Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and
was started on diltiazem before being transitioned to
amiodarone. Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], his PICC line was noted to
be advanced into the right atrium, and it was thought that this
may have been triggering his atrial fibrillation. During his
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**], he remained in sinus rhythm and with
excellent rate control. His amiodarone was discontinued.

5. Acute Renal Failure
During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as
1.9 and then remained stable between .[**8-31**].

6. Malnutrition
Patient was started on TPN at the OSH and was continued on this
during his hospitalization. He was NPO during this
hospitalization and was NPO on discharge. At rehab, we recommend
that he remain NPO for the first week. He could take sips for
comfort after this time.

7. Anemia
Unknown baseline. His hematocrit has remained stable during this
admission from 27-30.

8. Hyperglycemia
He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 25354**] and was continued on insulin during his
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**].
