Mrs. [**Known lastname 25006**] is a 72 year old female with stage IIIA
carcinosarcoma of the uterus and a stage I mucinous carcinoma of
the ovary undergoing carboplatin chemotherapy who presents with
hypotension.

# Hypotension - Etiology remained unclear. Differential
diagnosis included sepsis (perhaps [**3-18**] cellulitis of LE's, but
without other obvious infectious source), hypovolemia (but
appeared volume overloaded on exam), CHF with 3rd spacing of
volume but intravascular volume depletion, versus medication
(chemotherapy) side effect.  Differential also included
pericardial effusion and tamponade - ruled out by TTE. With
treatment of CHF (diuresis with one-time doses of lasix) and of
cellulitis (with antibiotics), saw patient's BP improve.
Antihypertensives held during hospitalization and on discharge.
Appears patient's baseline SBP is in the 90s. Patient ambulated
without lightheadedness.
.
# Hypoxia - Developed in OSH ED after she received IVF for her
hypotension; in the setting of AS and hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, likely became volume overloaded. Was voume
overloaded on exam, with crackles, peripheral edema, weight
elevation, BNP elevation. Other possibilites include worsening
of HOCM, or worsened diffuse pulmonary metastasis as seen on CT
in [**2121-2-14**] which may have further reduced pulmonary
reserve. With diuresis, patient's oxygen requirement resolved,
albeit slowly. CTA was done to rule out PE - negative for PE.
Patient ambulated without SOB and without desaturation. In fact,
SpO2 improved with ambulation, so perhaps there was an
atelectatic component (heard as crackles at the bases perhaps)
that improved with opening up of airways upon ambulation.
.
# Cellulitis - Bilateral erythema and warmth of lower legs on
exam.  Could be cellulitis vs. hyperemia from edema vs. reaction
to chemotherapy medications (patient reports redness in legs
previously when on this chemotherapy regimen). Patient treated
with vancomycin and then keflex. Patient diuresed with lasix
one-time doses.
.
# Acute renal failure - Baseline creatinine around 1 and 1.0 on
[**4-10**].  Was 2.2 at OSH and became 1.3 after getting IV hydration.
Seemed pre-renal etiology given improvement in creatinine w/ IV
fluids; then patient was diuresed for CHF/volume overload
concern, and Cr continued to improve down to 0.8.
.
# Tachycardic runs - appear to be SVT (narrow complex, regular,
no P waves, came on/off suddenly), seen intermittently and
asymptomatic. Ruled out PE with CTA.
.
# Normocytic Anemia - Was 32.8 at OSH; after receiving fluids
HCT has fallen further to 30. Baseline is 35 - 40. Not
clinically bleeding. Perhaps due to chemotherapy.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - 137 down from 700 earlier. Likely  related
to marrow suppression from chemotherapy.
.
# Asthma history? - continued home regimen of singulair,
fluticasone prn, and formulary exchange maxair with albuterol.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia - patient no longer taking fenofibrate
d/t concern for possible side effects.  Takes fluvastatin every
other day - formulary exchanged with pravastatin.
.
# Uterine & Ovarian cancer - plan for next chemotherapy on
Thursday [**4-24**], as an inpatient, due to concerns for side
effects and desire for o/n monitoring.
