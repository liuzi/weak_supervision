He presented to the ED with shortness of breath and change in
mental status.  He was admitted to the floor for ARF and COPD
exacerbation.  He then develooped AMS and and decreased
respiratory rate with a gas of 7.16/105/69.  This was thought to
 be secondary to methadone overdose due to taking 30mg [**Hospital1 **]
rather than 15mg [**Hospital1 **] when he received 10mg tabs rather than 5mg
tabs from his pharmacy.  He required BiPAP the first day in the
ICU given that his PCO2 was 105 on the floor.  He was started on
a narcan gtt with improvement of his respiratory status.  His
narcan gtt was discontinued on [**4-8**] in the AM as he was alert
and speaking farsi.  He was given fentanyl boluses and ativan
while in the ICU to help with withdrawal and to tx his restless
leg syndrome.  He was started on Solumedrol 125mg IV q6hrs which
was continued x2 days, then transitioned to prednisone. He was
also started on azithromycin.  [**4-9**] his home dose of methadone
was restarted 15mg PO BID.  Pt is on 2L oxygen at home but taken
off oxygen this AM with goal O2 sat 88-92% as likely is chronic
CO2 retainer. Patient??????s mental status is at baseline now

he does not have any history of COPD hospitalizations.  Code
