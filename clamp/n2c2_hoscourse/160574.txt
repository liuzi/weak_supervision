A/P: Pt is a 64 y.o female with MMP including CAD, CHF, DM,
CKD3, HTN, ETOH cirrhosis, h.o PE, s/p R.TKR who presents with
R.septic knee, [**Last Name (un) **], and hypotension.

#. Sepsis secondary septic R knee: Patient was admitted with
fever, leukocytosis, hypotension (requiring IVF resuscitation
and levophed for less than 24 hrs), and source of infection as
septic R knee (positive tap in ED), s/p instrumentation in the
past.  She has signs of organ dysfunction, mainly ARF.  Pt was
started on vanco/zosyn.  Ortho was consulted and took the
patient to the OR for total knee revision on [**2103-5-18**].  Her
instrumentation was removed and a temporary replacement was
placed.  The arthroplasty was sent for culture, which had no
grown. Tissue from the surgery also had no growth, but all knee
cultures were sent after recieving antibiotics.  She had a TTE
that did not visualize any vegetations though it was suboptimal.
 She also had an MRI of her entire spine to eval for other nidus
of infection/abscess given BUE and RLE pain/weakness.  The MRI
showed no evidence of abscess, diskitis, or osteomyelitis.  She
was continued on vancomycin and ceftriaxone which she will
continue for 6 weeks until she sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Infectious
Disease clinic on [**2103-7-2**].  She will need weekly CBC with DIFF,
Chem 7, LFTs, ESR, CRP, and vanco trough levels faxed to
Infectious Disease Fax #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 432**].  The patient will followup
in [**Hospital 5498**] clinic on [**2103-6-5**] for staple removal.  She will
have the hardware replaced in 6 weeks with orthopedics.

# Hypotension:  This was likely secondary to sepsis secondary to
infected R knee joint and this was treated as above.  She had a
cortisol stimulation that was normal.  She was not given
steroids.  Her antihypertensives were initially held, but
restarted prior to discharge.

#Acute Kidney Injury on CKD 3:  Pt's baseline Cr is 1.3-1.6, and
she presented this admission with Cr 3.4. Last admission she had
also presented with Cr 3.4 that resolved to 1.4 after IVF.  Her
CKD is likely secondary to HTN/DM. Acute on chronic renal
failure likely secondary to hypovolemia (pt given 3L in ED) plus
septic physiology.  At the time of discharge, her creatinine was
back to her baseline of 1.3.

# Cardiac:
1.  CAD:  Pt has h.o BMS to RCA in [**2102**].  Pt had presented with
chest pressure that lasted a few minutes.  EKG showed no acute
ischemic changes.  She was ruled out for MI by CEs x3.
Asa/plavix were initially held given OR plans.  BB, [**Last Name (un) **] were
initially held for hypotension.  Prior to discharge, she was
restarted on her cardiac meds.

2. History of chronic diastolic CHF/CMP:  She was initially
volume resuscitated.  She is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in heart
failure clinic.  She will be discharged on her Metoprolol
Succinate, diovan, and her statin as was previously prescribed.
Her lasix is to be used every other day as needed for weight
greater than 195 lbs.

# DM:  Pt was continued on Lantus, HISS.  Her glucose remained
in the 100s with her lantus not requiring sliding scale insulin.


# Pancreatic insufficiency:  Pt was continued on creon TID with
meals.

# Crohn's Disease: The patient is on Asacol as an outpatient.
She is also on Ciprofloxacin 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] chronically.  During her
hospitalization, ciprofloxacin was stopped since the patient is
already on ceftriaxone.  Her ciprofloxacin will be held until
she completes her course of ceftriaxone, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital **]
clinic will discuss with the patient's Gastroenterologist
whether this medication should be restarted.

# Chronic neuropathic/radicular pain:  Home long-acting
narcotics were initially held given her somnolence.  She was
continued on topimax, gabapentin, duloxetine.  At the time of
discharge, she was restarted on her Oxycontin at a lower dose of
20 mg TID with oxycodone 5 mg for breakthrough pain.  She is
also on standing acetaminophen.  Her Oxycontin can be uptitrated
to 40 mg TID as an outpatient if needed.

Initially, due to her mental status changes, it was thought that
this was likely secondary to narcotics, especially post
operatively.  A head CT did not show any evidence of hemorrhage.
  It was felt that the likely cause of her altered mental status
was the hydromorphone and her sepsis.  Hydromorphone has been
added to her allergy list.

# h/o TIA symptoms:  Neurology was not convinced presentation
was consistent with acute stroke during last admission.  She is
on ASA/plavix for secondary prevention.

The crohns disease and pancreatic insufficieny were stable.  She
is also on Ciprofloxacin 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] chronically. During her
hospitalization, ciprofloxacin was stopped since the patient is
already on ceftriaxone.  Her ciprofloxacin will be held until
she completes her course of ceftriaxone, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital **]
clinic will discuss with the patient's Gastroenterologist
whether this medication should be restarted.
