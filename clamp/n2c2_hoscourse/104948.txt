Note: the majority of this hospital course refers to the
patient's ICU course.  He was on the medical floor for 16 hours
prior to discharge and was stable during this time.
.
# Septic Shock:  Met criteria for septic shock.  On presentation
had clear pulmonary source of infection.  Initial sputums grew
out pneumococci.  Patient relatively immunocompromised due both
to cancer diagnosis and chronic steroid use secondary to brain
tumor.
  On admission patient had central line placed, CVPs maintained
[**7-15**].  Patient needed pressors to maintain BP initially.  On
levophed, but developed some tachyarrhythmnias (Afib with RVR)
so was switched to neo.  Initially covered with Zosyn, levoflox
and vanco.  Patient was continued on atovaquone for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 6187**].  Patient was also intubated on presentation, and
maintained on AC.  Patient had EKGs without signs of ischemia,
and  multiple sets of normal cardiac enzymes.  Pressors were
largely weaned by HD #3.  He did rarely require brief periods of
neosynepherine, due to too-rapid diuresis.
   The patient had a normal cortisol stim test.
   Historically, it was noted that the patient had a red left
knee a few days prior to admission.  This knee was tapped by
ortho and found to be floridly septic.  He was taken to the OR
and washed out by Ortho (please see seperate op note for full
accounting of this procedure).  This infection was found to be
MSSA, which also grew out of his blood and eventually out of his
R chest chemo-port, which was removed by surgery.  He was
maintained on a 6week course of Nafcillin for this staph
infection.  A TEE demonstrated no signs of endocarditis.
Infectious disease was consulted and assisted with his
antibiotic regimen.
   The patient completed a full 14d course of Levoflox for
pneumonia.  The patient also had a full course of Clinda for a
question of toxic shock syndrome or aspiration pneumonia.  His
Vanco was d/c'd after 5d due to only MSSA growing out.  On [**12-20**]
his pre-existing R chest chemo port was noted to be purulent and
was removed by surgery.  This grew out MSSA.  Once more, the
nafcillin was continued for 6week total course.
  A [**12-21**] culture grew out yeast and he was started on a course
of fluconisol as per ID.  He recieved a full Ophtho eval which
demonstrated no ocular involvment.
  Planned course of treatment is for nafcillin for total of 6
weeks to end [**1-30**], fluconazole for 2 weeks total to end [**1-9**], and
ceftriaxone to end [**1-10**].
.
# Afib c RvR:  New-onset afib in the face of sepsis,
hypotension, infection.  Patient initially controlled with
boluses of Diltiazem or Lopressor.  Often returned into Afib
during times of increased activity or stress.  Used
neosynepharine which seemed less arrhythmagenic.  Amiodarone was
tried initially for control, but the patient became to
bradycardic on this [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  As patient was weaned from pressors
he was begun on a regimen of metoprolol which seemed to control
his rate well.  He did ocassionally return to RVR, which was
treated with boluses of dilt or lopressor with good effect. He
was then restarted on amiodarone [**1-1**] and responded to it well.
Due to his brain tumor he was note anticoagulated during his
time in the ICU. The risks and benefits were discussed. It was
felt that the risks of ICH outweighed the benefits of stroke
prevention at this time. Plans were made to readdress this issue
once the patient's mental status improved.
.
# Septic Arthritis:  As above, had septic arthritis of L knee
treated via washout by ortho on [**12-17**].  Nafcillin x6weeks per ID
started on [**12-19**]. Nafcillin is scheduled to finish on [**1-30**].
Patient did have a swollen L wrist later in his course, but this
was tapped by Ortho and never grew out any bacteria.
Plastics-hand was consulted and felt clinically that this was
not a septic joint, instead just a manifestation of his chronic
RA.
 Ortho also felt it was not prudent to washout his R knee, which
was clinically asymptomatic during his ICU course. His L knee
healed well and the staples and drain were removed without
incidence.  He has been signed off from direct ortho care, and
is weight-bearing as tolerated at time of ICU discharge.
.
#Respiratory status:  Patient was maintained on ARDS-style
ventilation while on the ventilator.  He has a bronchoscopy on
[**12-18**] which showed diffuse thick bloody sputum greatest in the R
LL.  By [**12-19**] the patient was changed to pressure support
ventilation.  The patient was activily diuresed at this time,
with good effect and improving respiratory status.  The patient
tested negative for legionella and influenza.  The patient was
quickly weaned to CPAP+PS of [**4-7**], but was difficult to wean
fully from the vent due mainly to his mental status.   He was
extubated on [**12-24**] with great success.
  On [**12-25**] the patient was noted to have an increasing o2
requirement and a CXR demonstrated a moderate-sized R
pneumothorax.  Thoracic surgery was consulted and placed a chest
tube.  This tube was intermittantly to wall-suction, water-seal
or clamped.  On [**1-2**] it was d/c'd, with the pneumothoax smaller
in size.
.
#GBM:  Head CTs compared to his baseline [**Hospital1 2025**] scans showed no
interval change.  He was maintained on his baseline 3mg of
Dexamethasone while inpatient here. It appears that neurooncs
original plans were to taper the dexamethasone. We were unable
to contact primary neuro-oncoligist to discuss steroid taper but
this should be discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] when he becomes
available.
.
#Anemia/thrombocytopenia:  Had anemia of chronic disease,
admitted with thrombocytopenia attributed to Avastin and
timador.  His thrombocytopenia was asymptomatic during his
hospital course, and steadily improved.  His anemia was mild,
and did require occasional transfusion.
.
# Hyperglycemia:  Intitally hyperglycemic in face of sepsis,
controlled with SS insulin and resolved on its own.
.
#R Chest wound:  Con't to drain purulent material s/p removal of
port.  Surgery recommended QID dilute([**12-6**]) Dakin's solution and
close f/u.  Any fluctuant areas must be debrided.
.
#Mental Status:  The patient presented with altered mental
status felt to be due to sepsis.  He did take some days to
awaken from his intubated and sedated state.  He continued to be
Aox1-2 in the MICU, with symptoms consistent with delerium. A
repeat head CT showed no change; his delerium was felt to be
mainly post-septic and ICU related and appeared to be slowly
intervally improving each day.
.
#Prophylaxis: Patient was initially on pneumoboots and then
Heparin SC, a bowel regmimen and a Gi prophlyaxsis throughout
his hospital course.
.
# Electrolytes:  The patient required extensive repletion of his
potassium during his ICU course, often requiring q6hr lyte
checks and 100-200meq of K+ per day.  This was felt to be mostly
due to a diarrhea and thus GI loss, and was resolving at the end
of his hospital course as diarrhea resolved.
.
# Nutrition:  The patient was maintained on TF while intubated,
and also s/p intubation as he failed his initial speech and
swallow exams. On [**1-3**] he passed his speech and swallow bedside
test.
.
#LFTs:  Patient had elevated LFTs on presentation which were
attributed to sepsis.  This abnormality resolved as the
patient's clinical picture improved.  He should continue on
weekly LFT checks due to his continuing nafcillin.
.
# PT/OT:  after extubation the patient was followed actively by
PT and OT.
