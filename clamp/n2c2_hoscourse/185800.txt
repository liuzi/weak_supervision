63 year old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis and HCC,
osteoporosis, ovarian cysts, active smoker for 40 years, who
presented to OR for elective RFA as outpatient today and was
found to be hypotensive and bradycardic after administration of
sedatives for intubation. Her EKG was concerning for ST
depressions in the setting of hypotension, with a troponin
elevation, so patient underwent cardiac catheterization with no
angiographical flow limiting disease.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Hypotension: Pt was found to be hypotensive as low as systolic
60s, likely secondary to medications for induction.  Per PACU
notes, she received propofol, succ, rocuronium, fentanyl; she
was subsequently treated with IVFs, glycopyrrolate, and
neosynephrine with BP subsequently rising to 80s-90s.  Volume
depletion was  likely another contributing factor as pt had been
NPO since night prior to procedure and was fluid responsive in
PACU. She received additional fluid boluses in the ICU, but
still required dopamine temporarily overnight following her
procedure. She was quickly weaned off and she maintained her
blood pressure in the 90's-100's systolic afterwards.
.
# Bradycardia: This was also thought to be likely from agents
given for induction, particularly propofol and  succinylcholine.
 She also received esmolol after she became tachycardic from
glycopyrrolate.  Her bradycardia resolved over 24 hours.
.
# ST depressions: EKG showed ST depressions in lead V3-V6 that
were new from prior, in setting of bradycardia and hypotension.
Her repeat EKG later showed resolution of ST depressions.  Pt
was evaluated by cardiology who felt that ST depressions were
likely from demand ischemia from hypotension and bradycardia.
She had a troponin elevation to Trop elevated to 0.32 with mild
MB elevation to 8. Given that the patient is being evaluated for
transplantation, she underwent a cardiac catheterization which
revealed non significant coronary artery disease. She also had a
TTE which showed EF >55%, trace AR and MR.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# HCC: Pt with HCV cirrhosis that is well-compensated (Childs
[**Doctor Last Name 14477**] A).  She has no history of jaundice, encephalopathy,
ascites, or esophageal varices.  She will need to have her RFA
rescheduled and will require an anesthesia evaluation prior to
the procedure.
.
# Osteoporosis: continued home raloxifene, calcium and vitamin D
.
# Tobacco abuse: Pt was supplied a nicotine patch while in
hospital
.
Transitional Issues:
# blood cultures were pending at time of discharge.
.
# Pt's initial chest xray was concerning for pneumonia, however
pt was clinically well and asymptomatic. No antibiotics were
started but would have low threshold to initiate treatment for
pneumonia if pt develops symptoms.
.
# Pt will need to have her RFA rescheduled. She should have a
pre-op evaluation by anesthesia to determine the safety of the
procedure.
