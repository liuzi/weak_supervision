Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 72 yo M with h/o metastatic rectal CA and SVC
syndrome, now resolved on lovenox tx, who was admitted to OMED
on [**4-19**] with intractable diarrhea thought [**3-2**] chemo and
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**4-24**] with BRBPR and hematemesis. GI
was consulted and an EGD was performed on [**4-24**] which showed
diffuse erythema/ulceration, in esophagus, stomach, duodenum.
This was thought due to irinotecan induced GI toxicity.  They
recommended PPI and carafate slurry.  They were concerned that
patient's whole GI tract was diffusely inflamed as was seen on
EGD and that the anastamotic site from his colectomy might be a
bleeding source; a flex sigmoidoscopy was done on as well and
showed as well diffuse ulceration and inflammation. HCTs and q6H
hemodynamics remained stable throughout his hospital course.
The patient was started on steroid enemas and mesalamine
suppositories to decrease inflammation.  The steroid enemas were
discontinued, but the mesalamine suppositories were continued
through to discharge.  In total, he received 3 units PRBCs and 2
units of FFP. Stool cultures revealed no evidence of infection.
.
On [**4-24**], the patient was found to have that 2/2 bottles of his
blood cultures drawn from his portacath were growing GPCs,
speciation showed MSSA. He was treated for this with IV
vancomycin, leaving the portacath and PICC in place. Daily
surveillance blood cultures were performed and he was noted to
clear his bacteremia on [**4-26**].  Infectious diseases was consulted
and the patient was switched to nafcillin with confirmation of
MSSA.  The port-a-cath was removed which was the source of
infection.

The patient however despite aggressive crystalloid and colloid
(albumin, a further 2 units of blood) resuscitation then
developed sepsis related acute tubular necrosis.  The patient
became anuric and nephrology was consulted.  Hemodialysis was
initiated which the patient tolerated well, and a permanent
tunneled catheter line was placed on [**2134-5-7**].  The patient was
started on phosphate binders, nephrocaps and erythropoeitin
dosed at hemodialysis.  The carafate was discontinued due to
risk of aluminum toxicity.  The nafcillin was also changed to
Cefazolin dosed 2mg at each [**Date Range 2286**] session for ease of
administration and avoiding extra volume loading.  Should the
patient miss [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2286**] session, extra doses of cefazolin should
be administered as needed.  The patient was planned for a 28 day
course of cefazolin to be finished on [**2134-5-22**].
.
Other parts of his hospitalization are outlined by problem
below:
.
#Hypotension/Tachycardia: In setting of extensive diahrrea. Ct
torso is without PE or dissection. His BP initally recovered
with 500cc NS bolus.  Once he had an episode of BRBPR, he became
tacycardic to the 140s, with BP 90s/60s.  He was bolused NS and
given PRBC with improved HR to the 110s, and BP to 120s/80s.
.
#SVC syndrome: occurred in [**2132**]. s/p TPA infusion followed by
venous angioplasty with balloon dilation with resolution of
symptoms.  He was initially treated with lovenox (dose
recalculated this admission, should be lower than his admission
dose), but this was held secondary to GI bleed.  This was not
restarted at discharge given the patient's renal failure.
.
#Diarrhea - the patient continued to have diarrhea that was
controlled with titration of his anti-diarrheal medications.
Infectious sources were ruled out and the cause was likely
irinotecan-induced GI toxicity and radiation proctitis.

#Generalized anasarca - The patient was noted to have an
extremely low albumin on admission, likely related to poor
nutrition due to his GI pathology.  Albumins ranged between 2.7
and 1.9.  During volume resuscitation the patient became grossly
edematous, and albumin was administered to little effect.  His
left upper extremity was noted to be more edematous than the
rest of his body, and a LUE ultrasound was acquired.  This
demonstrated no evidence of clot.  The patient slowly became
less edematous when [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] was initiated and ultrafiltration
was started.

Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**]' code status was confirmed as FULL CODE  this hospital
admission.
