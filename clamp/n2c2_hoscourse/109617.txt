#. MSSA infection (including epidural abscesses/vertebral
osteo/meningitis/bacteremia/skin lesions/UTI): Pt found to have
MSSA from blood and also grew MSSA from urine.  Vancomycin was
started, then switched to Nafcillin when the organism was
identified. TTE was performed and showed no vegetations. It is
unknown what the portal of entry for the MSSA was. The
bacteremia, skin lesions and UTI resolved with appropriate
antibiotic therapy. Ortho spine was consulted and recommended
serial imaging to determine whether epidural abscesses were
increasing in size or causing spinal cord compression. Pt got
MRIs approximately once a week and on the 3rd it was more clear
that the patient would require surgery. She underwent
neurosurgery [**10-30**] and for epidural abscess drainage (and C7
corpectomy, C4-T1 fusion, T3-4 laminectomy).  Multiple abscesses
present (~5, with 3 major ones), hardware place, cultures sent,
debrided.  Upon repeat imaging post operatively, MRI showed
expanding T-spine epidural abscess, so she then underwent L
spine decompression [**11-2**] with debridement.  Per ID, Gentamycin
was added to help with Nafcillin penetration for a 5-day course,
which was completed on [**11-6**]. Pt will continue on nafcillin for
at least 8 weeks and will follow up with spine and ID.  Her
tentative stop date for nafcillin is [**2187-12-29**], or it may be
stopped on [**12-14**] when she visits ID.  She has an appointment with
Spinal surgery on [**2186-12-27**].  she will need to have her staples
removed on [**2187-11-23**] in rehab with log role [**Last Name (LF) 10313**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Spine
surgery. She is to have weekly [**First Name3 (LF) **] draws faxed to the Infectious
Disease Physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
.
#Hospital Acquired Pneumonia: treated for HAP with vancomycin
and cefepime from [**11-11**] through [**11-18**].  Her nafcillin was
stopped during this treatment and was restarted on [**11-19**].
.
#. Altered mental status: The patient was initially minimally
responsive. This was thought to be secondary to meningitis as
well as the severity of her infection. This resolved
substantially with antibiotics. She did remain minimally
delerious throughout her stay (generally oriented x3 with
moments of confusion). MRI head was normal.
.
# Weakness: As pt's mental status improved and she became
cooperative with  neuro exam, it became clear that she had
diffuse weakness with some focality (especially R arm) with
sensation relatively intact. Neurology was consulted who felt
that some of the weakness could be [**12-25**] cord inflammation and so
pt recieved pulsed steroids early in her admission without
significant effect. Pt underwent EMG which showed a mixed
picture (see EMG report for full details). Pt did undergo
decompression on [**10-30**] and [**11-2**] but strength remained similar.
.
#. GI Bleed:  On [**2187-10-28**] pt developed melanotic stools and a
hematocrit drop from 24 to 20. IV PPI was continued and she
recieved 1U of prbcs and had an EGD which showed severe
ulcerations in stomach and duodenum most consistent with nsaid
use (pt did use ibuprofen at home). Per pt she had had a normal
colonoscopy at [**Hospital1 112**] 4 yrs ago and this was not repeated as an
inpt. Pt also reports h/o duodenal ulcers in the [**2147**]. An h
pylori was sent and was positive. Treatment of h pylori was
deferred in setting of nafcillin therapy and severe infection.
Pt was continued on PPI, eventually  transitioned to PO. Pt will
need 2 week course of amoxicillin and clarithromycin after her
nafcillin treatment is complete (nafcillin does not cover h
pylori.)
She should continue lansoprazole until her visit with the
Gastroenterologist in [**Month (only) 404**].
.
#. Persistent Sinus Tachycardia: Pt maintained HR of ~100
throughout her admission (~1 month). This was felt to most
likely be related to her severe underlying infection and
recurrent low grade fevers. Intravascular volume depletion was
also a likely contributor given pt's low albumin and anasarca
and clinical appearance of being dry (dry mouth, low JVP). PE
was considered, however, pt was on DVT ppx throughout admission
and EKG did not have any changes. Further, pt's oxygen
requirement was minimal to none and ultimately it was decided
that PE was highly unlikely. Also given her prolonged stay may
be a PE, though this is less likely.
.
#. Edema: Patient was noted to have anasarca and an albumin of
1.9. Pt was not diuresed aggressively as she appeared
intravascularly depleted and had minimal oxygen requirement. Her
edema improved upon discharge.
.
#. Anemia: Pt remained anemic throughout her stay. Perhaps she
has had ulcers for some time contributing to her anemia. Her
reticulocyte count was 6.7 arguing against marrow suppression as
the etiology, however, iron studies were consistent with anemia
of chronic disease. The transfusion goal was set at 22. She
recieved 2U of PRBCs throughout her stay.
.
#. Pain: Patient had severe back pain throughout her admission
that was ultimately treated with a fentanyl patch with small
boluses of IV morphine for breakthrough pain. A kanair bed was
also found to help with her pain.
.
#. Rash: On admission pt had 2 rashes. She had diffuse small
pustules which grew MSSA and resolved c antibiotics. She also
had, on the left back, a 4 x 3cm erythematous plaque with a
central brown / black, rough, necrotic area which was biopsied
by dermatology and showed "Focal necrotizing vasculitis in
mid-dermis with focal thrombosis, and ischemic necrosis of
epidermis and appendages" which dermatology felt was consistent
with a reactive process, rather than representing a primary
vasculitis, given the clinical scenerio.
.
#. Acute renal failure: Pt had [**Last Name (un) **] on admission, which resolved
c IVF.
.
#. Elevated transaminases: Pt had elevated LFTs on admission,
most likely from poor perfusion in the setting of dehydration or
billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS.  RUQ ultrasound
unremarkable. This was trended and resolved.
.
#. Thrombocytopenia: in combination with direct bilirubinemia
was concerning for consumptive process like TTP or DIC on
admission, however no chistocytes on smear.  Most likely due to
poor production in the setting of infection and resolved during
admission.
.
#. Nutrition: she failed speech and swallow on [**11-12**].  A
percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube was placed on [**11-15**] and tube
feeds continued.
.
# Electrolyte Abnormalities: Patient had persistent hypokalemia
and hypophosphatemia. Standing electrolyte orders were instilled
and should be continued in rehab until levels normalize. Also, a
Chem-10 should be checked every other day while taking these
medications.

#. Access: Patient has a PICC placed in the right arm on
[**2187-10-19**].
