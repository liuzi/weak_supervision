The patient was re-admitted on [**2146-3-10**] back to the General
Surgical Service for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain
and tachycardia.  Admission abdominal/pelvic CT revealed minimal
interval increase in size of right upper quadrant pancreatic
pseudocyst, but decrease in size of remaining loculated fluid
collections. Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated
compression atelectasis were noted, as well as increased amount
of abdominal and pelvic free fluid. He was admitted to the SICU,
made NPO, started on vigorous IV fluid rescusitation, a foley
was placed, and he received IV pain medication with good effect.
He had a very long, and complicated hospital course.
.
In the process of repairing his florid necrotizing pancreatitis
secondary to his history of severe gallstone pancreatitis, he
ultimately developed recurrent pseudocyts, which have plagued
him throughtout his hospital stays since [**48**]/[**2145**]. To date, these
pseudocyts have been managed largely with percutaneous catheter
drainage of the pseudocysts. Initially, during this admission,
this was the approach to managing the patient's recurring
pseudocyts. The patient underwent drainage of pancreatic
pseudocysts on [**2146-3-10**] and [**2146-3-18**], Ultrasound and CT-guided,
respectively. However, he developed an accumulating posterior
retroperitoneal cyst, which continued to progress, and there was
evidence of a disconnected pancreatic remnant within it. The
recent drainages of the other satellite lesions have dried them
up. The main retroperitoneal cyst continued to grow in size, and
became symptomatic for him. He was unable to eat full meals and
has a diminished capacity to keep food down, as well as a poor
appetite. He also repeatedly spiked temperatures.
.
Given his history of a left lower extremity acute deep venous
thrombosis, Vascular Surgery was consulted. In lieu of planned
surgical intervention on [**2146-4-5**] for treatment of the above
pseudocyst with adhesions, the patient underwent placement of a
Bard G2 inferior vena cava filter, which went without
complication. Then on [**2146-4-5**], the patient underwent external
drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst and extended adhesiolysis,
which also went well without complication (see Operative Note).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient was
returned to the floor NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids and TPN,
with a foley catheter and two JP drains in place (one in the
pseudocyst and one in the abdomen to drain ascites), he was
continued on a Fentanyl patch and was given a Morphine PCA with
good effect. He was hemodynamically stable.
.
NEURO: Upon admission, the patient received IV pain medication
PRN transitioned to a Morphine PCA with good effect and adequate
pain control. When tolerating oral intake, he was transitioned
to oral pain medications. After the surgery on [**2146-4-5**], the
Chronic Pain Service was consulted. His pain was controlled once
the Fentanyl dose was increased to 75mcg/72Hr plus the Morphine
PCA. When again tolerating a diet post-operatively, the PCA was
discontinued, and he was started on oral pain medication in
addition to the Fentanyl patch with continued good effect. He
remained neurologically intact.
.
CV: Upon admission, tachycardia responded to vigorous IV fluid
rescusitation and beta-blockade with Metoprolol 50mg TID.
Metoprolol was increased to 75mg TID with eventual excellent
rate and BP control. By discharge, the Metoprolol was decreased
to 50mg [**Hospital1 **]. The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
.
PULMONARY: Tachypnea on admission. Chest CTA revealed large
bilateral pleural effusions with associated compression
atelectasis. Tachypnea resolved with diuresis with Lasix and
supplemental oxygen. He was given Albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizer treatments, good pulmonary toilet and use of the
incentive spirrometry were encouraged, and the patient received
chest PT with improvement in overall respiratory status. Able to
wean off supplemental oxygen. CXR on [**3-17**] revealed still
extremely low lung volumes. Hazy opacification at the left base
is consistent with pleural fluid. Obscuration of the
hemidiaphragm suggests volume loss in the left lower lobe. The
right lung was essentially clear and there was no evidence of
pulmonary vascular congestion.

Starting on [**4-12**], he spiked a temperature to 103 PO and his WBC
increased from 13 to 23,000.  He had a CT abdomen performed
which demonstrated a left pleural effusion
on the upper cuts of the abdomen. Thoracic surgery was consulted
for management of the pleural effusion. On [**2146-4-14**], he underwent
ultrasound-guided thorocentesis and placement of left pleural
pigtail catheter. Plural fluid for culture, gram stain,
cytology, chemistries, and AFB was sent. The pleural pigtail
catheter was removed on [**4-15**]; post-removal CXR revealed minimal
apical and lateral basal pneumothorax without evidence of
tension. Unchanged minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. A
follow-up CXR on [**2146-4-18**] showed continued low lung volumes with
left basilar subsegmental atelectasis, likely related to the
recent abdominal surgery and ongoing intra-abdominal process. No
appreciable residual left pneumothorax was seen. The patient
remained stable from a pulmonary standpoitn thereafter.
Respiratory toilet, incentive spirrometry, and frequent
ambulation was encouraged.
.
GU/FEN: On admission, the patient was made NPO and he received
vigorous IV fluid rescusitation. A foley catheter was placed.
Allowed clears on [**3-11**] and [**3-12**], but an NG tube was placed on
[**3-13**] for increased abdominal distension and emesis resulting
with 1400mL bilious output. After successful clamp trial
overnight, the NG tube was discontinued on [**3-15**] in the morning.
Given persistent problems with tolerating oral intake, a PICC
was placed, and TPN was started on [**2146-3-14**]. With the decision
to proceed to surgery, TPN was continued through [**2146-4-12**]. When
not NPO for procedures, his diet was advanced back to low fat
regular with good tolerability and intake. When the foley
catheter was removed after surgery, he was able to void without
problem. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and
IV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.
.
GI: Admission liver and pancreatic enzymes were elevated.
Shortly after admission, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided
pseudocyst drainage measuring 1.7 liters of fluid with a
drainage catheter left in place to gravity on [**2146-3-10**]. Liver
and pancreatic enzymes began trending down. Follow-up
abdominal/pelvic CT on [**3-16**] demonstrated enlargement of the
previously seen fluid collection and appearance of the numerous
new large collections in the peritoneum. The drained collection
had significantly decreased in size. On [**3-18**], the patient
returned to Interventional Radiology for drainage of an anterior
collection, and placement of a new drainage catheter to gravity.
The previous drain was removed, and upper abdominal pseudocyst
was succesfully drained with a catheter left in place to
gravity. Unfortunately, as noted above, he developed an
accumulating posterior retroperitoneal cyst, which continued to
progress, and there was evidence of a disconnected pancreatic
remnant within it. He underwent external drainage of pancreatic
pseudocyst and extended adhesiolysis as described above. A (L)
flank drain was left in place. After the surgery, his symptoms
improved.
.
ID: Admission blood cultures were negative. [**3-10**] fluid culture
had no growth. On [**3-17**] after receiving FFPs, the patient mounted
a fever with a Tmax 101.5 PO. Blood cultures were negative.
Fluid cutlure from the [**3-18**] drainage also revealed no growth.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely
watched for signs of infection. Admission MRSA screen was
negative. After the [**2146-4-5**] surgery, cultures from the peritoneal
fluid on [**4-14**], the (L) JP on [**4-19**], and the flank drain on [**4-21**]
all grew out MRSA. The patient had been started on empiric IV
Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl when he spiked a
temperature on [**4-14**]. Fluconazole for empiric coverage after the
thorocentesis was started on [**4-15**]. Flagyl, Cipro, and
Fluconazole were discontinued on [**4-16**]. Cipro restarted on [**4-21**].
Infectious Disease was consulted for discharge antibiotic
recommendations; their input was greatly appreciated. Cipro was
discomntinued, and oral Levofloxacin and Flagyl started on [**4-26**]
with Vancomycin continued. At discharge, the patient was sent
home on a two week course oral Linezolid, and a total of four
weeks of oral Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
.
ENDOCRINE: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay when he was on TPN; sliding scale insulin was
administered accordingly. He did not require exogenous insulin.
.
HEMATOLOGY: Upon admission, Coumadin was stopped, and the
patient received 5 untis of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFPs) prior to
fluid collection drainage in Intervention Radiology. On [**3-17**],
FFPs were again administered in preparation for IR drainage of a
large anterior abdominal fluid collection, but was stopped after
the patient experienced severe lower back pain after initiation
of the second unit of FFP. On [**3-18**], he received a total of 4
units of FFPs prior to IR drainage of the aforementioned
collection. Prior to [**2146-4-5**] surgery, the patient received 2
units of PRBCs for a HCT of 22.2. He did not require any further
blood products after this date. At discharge, his HCT was 23.7.
.
PROPHYLAXIS: History left common iliac DVT and HITs. Repeat
duplex ultra-sound on admission confirmed persistent
non-occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein; no right
DVT was seen. Chest CTA did not reveal a PE. On admission,
Coumadin stopped, and Agatroban started. After the drainage of
the collection on [**3-10**], Agatroban was stopped, and Coumadin
restarted. Coumadin also restarted after reversal for second
collection drainage. After the surgery on [**2146-4-5**], the patient
was restarted on Argatroban. He was again converted back to
Coumadin prior to discharge, at which time the INR was
therapeutic at 3.2 on a Coumadin dose of 2.5mg daily. INR goal
2.5 with a therapeutic range of [**3-2**].
.
MOBILITY: The patient worked with Physical and Occupation
therapy extensively. By discharge, he was able to ambulate
independently. He was discharge home with PT and OT services.
.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating with minimal assistance, voiding without
assistance, and pain was well controlled.  He was discharged
home with VNA and PT services. The patient received discharge
teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.
