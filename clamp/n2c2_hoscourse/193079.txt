This is a 67 yo female with h/o stage IV ovarian ca s/p surgery,
6 cycles of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol, cyst aspiration of a cerebellar lesion
and Cyberknife treatments now admitted with increased HAs, n/v,
dysarthria likely [**2-6**] increased edema in brain lesion.
.
# N/V/dysarthria: Pt was initially admitted to the neurosurgical
service in the ICU for close observation. A head CT was
performed which revealed cerebellar cyst versus edema. She was
given 10mg decadron, IV hydration, Decadron 4mg Q6h. She
underwent an MRI w and w/o contrast which showed enlargement in
the size of the left posterior fossa cystic lesion and increase
in the surrounding vasogenic edema and increased mass effect on
the fourth ventricle.  Overnight, she neurologically improved.
Her dysarthria, H/A & N/V resolved. Pt was transferred to OMED
floor, where she continued to be largely aymptomatic.  Neurosurg
attempted to drain from the cystic lesion, however, was
unsuccessful.  The drainage was then planned by IR the next day
and approx 14cc of fluid was drained.  The fluid was sent to the
lab for analysis.  likely [**2-6**] increased edema seen on imaging.
Pt was continued on Reglan PRN, Compazine PRN and Zofran PRN for
nausea.  At discharge, Dexamethasone was started to be tapered.
Pt was also initiated on Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
.
# Hyponatremia: Her Na was initially 125.  Likely SIADH [**2-6**]
brain edema. Improved with fluid restriction and salt tabs. Na
133 on day of discharge.
.
# Stage IV ovarian cancer:  Pt was continued on pain control
with home Motrin, Oxycodone PRN.  Pt has f/u MRI and appt on
[**2120-1-28**] with Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic.  Given pt's unusual metastatic
spread of her ovarian cancer to the brain and history of
prostate cancer in the family at a young age, it can be
considered to do genetic testing (incl BRCA) as outpt.
.
# Depression/Insomnia:  Pt was continued on home Citalopram and
Ativan qhs PRN.
.
# HTN/HL:  Pt was continued on home HCTZ, Lisinopril, Verapamil.
 It can be considered as outpt to discontinue HCTZ, given pt's
persistent hyponatremia.  Pt was continued on home Simvastatin.

.
# Pt was on a regular diet, oncology repletion scales. Pain
control was with Motrin, Oxycodone PRN.  Pt was on a bowel
regimen and a PPI.  Pt was on DVT PPx with SC Heparin.  Pt was
full code.
