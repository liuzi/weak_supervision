73F PMHx of DM, seizure disorder and breast cancer, found down
on her floor with R hip fx s/p fall, admitted to the ICU with
hip fx, ARF, NSTEMI, and hypoxia. Hospital course by problem:

# Elevated Cardiac Enzymes and EKG Changes: Had elevated
troponins in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **] and new TWI both in the setting
of anemia. [**Hospital **] medical regimen included ASA 81mg, statin
80mg daily, and beta blocker. ACE-I was held given recent acute
on chronic renal failure and preserved EF as seen on echo (see
below).
.
# Right Hip Fracture s/p Fall.  Pt was evaluated by orthopedics
who planned for
minimally invasive pinning procedure pending medical clearance,
which was provided by daughter, [**Name (NI) 1785**], as pt was delirious.
Went to OR on [**2128-2-16**], no complications intra-op, but did go back
ot the ICU for overnight monitoring as she had some hypoxia
postoperatively (had received a larga amount of morphine). She
commenced PT POD#1, and was significantly limited by pain, but
this improved by POD#3 (ay of d/c). She did receive narcotics
around the time of PT to aid in progress.  Pain was also managed
with tylenol. She was discharged on lovenox 40mg sQ daily for
DVT ppx, and with orthopedic followup.

# Pancyopenia: Presented with acute on chronic anemia with
baseline in low 30s, as well as thrombocytopenia with nadir
platelets in the 40s, and leukopenia to a nadir of 2.1 Felt
likely [**1-13**] methotrexate use with questionable use of folate
(marrow suppressive process).  She was transfused 3 units in the
ICU and on HD#2 had a stable Hct to 32.8.  DDAVP was given for
low platelets. Her methotrexate was held, she received
supplemental folic acid, and all cell lines recovered to normal
by discharge. She will followup with erh rheumatologist for ?
resumption of methotrexate.

# Acute Kidney Injury: Baseline creatinine = 1.3, but she
presented with creatinine 1.8 -> max of 2.2 in setting of fall.
Normal CKs made rhabdo unlikely. Felt likely [**1-13**] hypoperfusion
and prerenal state.  Pt. was given IVF boluses and Cr decreased
to 1.3 by discharge.

# Transaminitis: Had elevations of ALT, AST and Alk Phos without
elevation in bilis. Unclear etiology, felt [**1-13**] mild ischemic
liver in setting of hypotension. Her methotrexate was also held.
LFTs had entirely normalized by discharge.

# IDDM: well-controlled by A1c.  FS were checked every 4 hours
and she was placed on an insuling sliding scale.  Her lisinopril
was held. On discharge,her metformin was continued, but
lisinopril was still held in setting of recent acute renal
failure.

# Fall: unclear etiology in pt with h/o seizure d/o and multiple
CAD risk factors.
Her cardiac enzymes were followed and Trop was trended from
0.16-->0.22-->0.22, so an MI could be the etiology but this
could also have been a conseqeunce of her fall. Further syncope
workup included monitoring on telemetry without significant
arryhtmia, sending a tegretol level (normal), repeating EKGs
(developed signs of MI), and carotid ultrasounds which were
normal. Head CT and Cspine Ct in ED were negative.

# Hypoxia - pt still had minimal O2 requirement on d/c. Has
known OSA per prior sleep evaluations. Also received many liters
of IVF and 3 units of blood during her hospital course, so ?
some element of hypervolemia, but phsical exam did not support
this. Echo performed this admission revealed preserved EF of
60-65% but markedly dilated RV with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. There was abnormal diastolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular volume overload. There was
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. This was
thought to possible represent sequelae from her MI. Pulmonary
embolism was on the differential but given her acute on chronic
renal failure, a CT-A was deferred, and the patient was allowed
to autodiurese and recover from the imediate postoperative
period and wean off of narcotics. If persistent, this could be
further worked up as an outpatient.

# RA:  methotrexate was held during admission given pancytopenia
above.

# Depression: dx with mild depression - Effexor therapy was
continued

# Dementia/Delerium: unclear circumstances of diagnosis, per
record patient reporting forgetfulness, psych testing showing
mild attention deficits.  She was continued on Aricept. She did
experience significant delirium during her hospitalization which
had improved by her discharge, but was still present in a waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] nature but easily treated with reorientation and
discontinuation of foley catheter, telemetry, and hydration. She
does have followup scheduled with her cognitive neurologist.

# FEN:
pt was seen by speech and swallow who recommended:
1. Continue current diet of thin liquids and puree.
2. Pills whole or crushed with puree.
3. 1:1 supervision for all POs.
4. Give POs ONLY when patient is most awake and alert.
5. Nutrition consult.
6. Recommend repeat swallowing evaluation at rehab prior to
upgrading diet.

# Prophylaxis: will be on lovenox 40mg sQ daily until ealry
[**Month (only) 547**] for DVT ppx, also d/c'ed on bowel regimen
