78F with history of acute myelofibrosis with panmyelosis (a rare
form of acute leukemia), neutropenic, recent admission for mild
pancreatitis as well as neutropenic fever after experimental
chemotherapy cycle(C1D8 of Protocol 08-269 A Phase I (RAD001
PKC412, day 1=[**2198-4-5**], last dose [**2198-4-12**]), now presenting with
tongue and anterior neck swelling likely [**1-24**] lisinopril allergy

#. Tongue/neck swelling/Allergy to ACEI: Most likely allergic
reaction to ACEI (was on lisinopril).  Less likely etiologies
would be her study drug for myelofibrosis.  Patient received IV
steroids, benadryl and famotidine with improvement in symptoms,
and was switched to a PO regimen of prednisone 60 mg for a total
of 3 days..  Did not have stridor nor require intubation.
Allergy was consulted and felt that swelling likely [**1-24**] ACEI so
lisinopril was dc'ed and she is not to take ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **] in the
future.  It was also recommended that she receive her study drug
under observation such as in the infusion clnic to monitor for
possible reaction.  Tryptase was sent to evaluate for C1
esterase inhibitor deficiency and is still pending.

#. Hypertension: Given likely allergy to lisinopril, it was
stopped.  Home metoprolol was continued at 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] and
amlodipine 5mg daily started to help better control BP, as she
had SBP 150-160s.

#. Myelofibrosis with panmyelosis: on C1D26 or experimental
chemotherapy regimen. Recommenedation that pt should receive
experimental medications while observed as above. Continued
prophylactic levofloxacin and valacyclovir as well as home dose
allopurinol. Transfused 1 unit platelets and 1 unit of PRBC
during admission
