  The patient was admitted for repair of her
incarcerated parastomal hernia. She was taken to the
Operating Room on [**2121-11-3**] for reduction, as well as
colostomy re-siting into the left upper quadrant. For details
of this, please see the previously dictated operative note.

Postoperatively, the patient's course was complicated by what
was thought to be an aspiration event on the evening of
postoperative day number two. She had acute respiratory
distress, as well as change in mental status, which is
different from her baseline. She was maintained with Lasix
diuresis and face mask for approximately 8-12 hours but then
was subsequently intubated and transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit for worsening respiratory status. She was initially
only intubated for about 24 hours and met all criteria for
extubation. Chest x-ray did confirm that she had bilateral
upper zone infiltrates and the patient was empirically
treated with a seven day course of vancomycin and Levaquin.
After the patient met her respiratory extubation criteria,
she was extubated. She continued to do fairly well but had
change in mental status, which could not be attributed to
anything other than alcohol withdrawal. TSH, B-12 and folate
levels were checked, which were normal. CT scan of the head
was obtained on [**2121-11-10**], which did not show any evidence
of acute injury. There was some evidence of old lacunar
infarcts. MR of the head was completed on [**2121-11-12**], which
confirmed the above. In addition, the Neurology service was
consulted for her change in mental status and they felt it
was best attributed also to her alcohol withdrawal, as well
as withdrawal from her Serax. These were restarted per their
recommendations and the patient gradually improved some of
her mental status.

On [**2121-11-10**], the patient was re-intubated (postoperative
day number seven) for worsening respiratory status. She was
maintained and ventilated during this time and had a
bronchoscopy performed on [**2121-11-13**], which proved to be
negative for any significant pluggings or other bronchial
disease. The patient was extubated later that day on
[**2121-11-13**], but then quickly failed her extubation trial
within approximately six hours. She was emergently re-
intubated and there was seen to be a fair amount of tracheal
and laryngeal edema at that time. The decision was then made
to give the patient a surgical airway and percutaneous
tracheostomy was performed on [**2121-11-14**]. This was done in
accordance and consent with her son, who was the healthcare
proxy during her change in mental status.

Ultimately, the patient was discharged on postoperative day
number fourteen to a [**Hospital 4820**] rehabilitation facility for
ventilatory weaning, as well as allowing clearance of her
mental status. The Neurology service had seen the patient on
the day of discharge and agreed with the above and to
continue present management. The patient had a post-pyloric
feeding tube placed in Interventional Radiology on the day of
discharge in order to decrease the risk of aspiration
pneumonia. The patient was tolerating tube feeds adequate and
had good function with occasional tracheostomy mask trials
from the vent.
