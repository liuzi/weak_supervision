76 year old male with multiple medical problems including CHF,
COPD, and ILD with very poor respiratory reserve presenting with
hypoxemic respiratory failure with fever and hypotension.

1) Pulmonary (Hypoxic Respiratory Failure): Patient was
initially admitted to MICU where intubation was required from
[**2085-5-18**]. Multiple etiologies were considered to explain his
hypoxic respiratory failure. At baseline patient has
interstitial lung disease and COPD. Given fever, leukocytosis,
sputum, elevated lactate multifocal pneumonia was also
considered and ultimately treated with Vancomycin and Cefepime.
Unfortunately, all sputum cultures were contaminated. During
patient's MICU stay he was diuresed with IV lasix gien concern
for a possible element of volume overload as well though BNP,
while elevated, was less than previous values on admission for
CHF exacerbation. PE was considered however thought to be
unlikely given evidence for multiple other processes to explain
respiratory failure. Further, patient was anticoagulated making
PE less likely. With history of COPD steroid taper was started
as well as standing nebs. Patient was eventually weaned to 2L NC
and transferred to the floor. On the floor patient finished the
course of antibiotics for HAP, continued diuresis, and standing
nebs. He continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint
until [**5-31**] whent he patient was found to be somnolent with
decreased respiratory drive and ABG 7.30/71/146/36. Patient was
then transferred to the MICU where mental status cleared and
hypercarbic respiratory failure resolved. This somnolence and
diminished respiratory drive was thought to be secondary to
small increase in the patient's gabapentin dose which he was
taking for post herpetic neuralgias. After patient returned to
the floor he was continued on a small dose of PO lasix per
outpatient regimen, prednisone taper, and standing nebs. Because
the patient was deconditioned and continued to have desats the
mid 80s on 2L while ambulating he was discharged to rehab.
.
2)AMS: On [**5-31**], he was noted to be increasingly altered and
confused, pulling at his oxygen, picking at his clothing and
mumbling nonsense. His ABG at the time was 7.30/71/146/36. His
O2 was removed to see if his respiratory drive was depressed,
but he desatted down to 70% and needed to have the oxygen
replaced. Transferred to the MICU as noted above. This AMS was
in the setting of neurontin dosing for zoster related ear pain.
He was monitored and improved in the ICU with very little
intervention other than holding his neurontin.

3) Presumed Bacterial Pneumonia: The patient had increased
sputum in the context of fever, leukocytosis, and bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates suggesting pneumonia. All sputum cultures
were contaminated and urine legionella was negative. Given
history of MRSA and multifocal infiltrate patient was treated
with Vanc, Cefepime for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia.

4) Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive in the context of
receiving nitroglycerin but remained hypotensive once this
medication was stopped. Initially patient required
norepinephrine which was quickly weaned. Given concern for
adrenal insufficiency stress dose steroids were initiated at
50mg IV hydrocortisone Q6hrs. This was weaned to PO
hydrocrotisone twice daily. Eventually, blood pressures
stabilized and anti hypertensive agents were restarted.
.
5) Chronic systolic CHF/ Dilated Cardiomyopathy: During
admission patient was thought to be slightly volume overloaded
despite an elevated BNP that was lower than prior admissions.
During his stay he was diuresed with IV lasix and then converted
to 20mg PO lasix at the time of discharge. Patient was continued
on QOD digoxin and while his beta blocker and [**Last Name (un) **] were initially
held these were restarted prior to discharge.
.
6) Stage IV CKD: On admission Creatinine was not markedly
elevated from baseline. Throughout the hospitalization
creatinine fluctuated between 1.3 - 2 depending on the degree of
diuresis. Nephrotoxins were avoided when possible.
.
7) AF: Patient is pacemaker dependent. Coumadin was continued
while inpatient. During admission INR became supratherapeutic
and Coumadin was held. During this time as noted below patient
developed GI Bleed which reguired reversal of INR and heparin
gtt. At discharge patient will continue coumadin per home
regimen 2.5mg Daily, except Tuesdays when he will take 1.5mg.
.
8) History of DVT: Continued coumadin
.
9) Adrenal Insufficiency: Initially patient was hypotensive so
stress dose steroids were initiated as above. Once blood
pressures stabilized patient was transitioned to home
hydrocortisone regimen.
.
10) Chronic Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia thought to be
related to chronic kidney disease. As an outpatient patient
recieves EPO injections Monthly. During admission patients HCT
trended down in the setting of supratherapeutic INR and GI bleed
as noted below. Patient was transfused two units pRBCs when
HCT<21. HCT will be followed as an outpatient and EPO injections
will be continued.
.
11) Recent Herpes Zoster: Pt received >7 days of therapy for
zoster and no active lesions. No vision changes or eye
involvement. Patient was continued on gabapentin 300mg [**Hospital1 **]. Post
herpetic neuralgias continued to bother patient during the
hospitalization, patient reported [**12-6**] pain, and gabapentin was
increased to 400mg TID. The day following this change the
patient became increasingly somnolent as noted above. Gabapentin
at that time was stopped with improvement in mental status.
Scheduled tylenol was continued for pain. Narcotics and
neurontin were avoided given the somnolence noted above.
.
12) Hyperlipidemia: Continued rosuvastatin
.
13) GI Bleed: On [**5-29**], patient developed dark melenotic stool in
the setting of a supratherapeutic INR. INR was reversed with Vit
K 5 mg PO, GI was consulted, and IV PPI 40mg [**Hospital1 **] was started.
HCT was followed and was relatively stable. GI deferred
endoscopy given the patient's stability and poor respiratory
status given concern the patient would reguire intubation for
the procedure. At discharge patient will continue Omeprazole
40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will arrange for further GI evaluation once
patient is optomized from a respiratory standpoint.
.
14) Non Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia: Throughout the
hospitalization patient had NSVT. The longest run of NSVT was 22
beats during which patient was asymptomatic. Patient has BiV ICD
in place. Electrophysiology [**Last Name (STitle) 6349**] pacemaker and it was found
to be functioning normally. EP noted that the patient's
pacemaker will pace patient out of this concerning rhythm if
rate exceeds 140 bpm. Metoprolol was uptitrated to 25mg Daily
with the hopes of decreasing the frequency of this rhythm.
