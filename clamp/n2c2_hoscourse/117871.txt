Mr. [**Known lastname 101426**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2119-7-14**] for a cardiac
catheterization. This revealed significant left main and three
vessel coronary artery disease. As he developed chest pain
during his catheterization, an intra-aortic balloon pump was
placed. The cardiac surgical service was urgently consulted and
surgical revascularization was recommended. Mr. [**Known lastname 101426**] was
taken urgently to the operating room where he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting to three vessels. Please see operative
note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive
care unit for monitoring. The next morning, his intra-aortic
balloon pump was weaned off and removed without incident. He
then awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. On
postoperative day two, he developed a right pneumothorax
following removal of his chest tubes. A right pleural tube was
thus placed with resolution of his pneumothorax. Later on
postoperative day two, he was transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. After a water seal trial, the right pleural
chest tube was removed and he subsequently developed a large
right pneumothorax that required a chest tube to be reinserted.
Follow up chest X-Ray revealed right lung rexpanded. This chest
tube wsa pulled [**7-19**] without incident after clamping and serial
CXR. The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance
with his postoperative strength and mobility. Beta blockade,
aspirin and a statin were resumed. Mr. [**Known lastname 101426**] continued to
make steady progress and was cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for discharge
to home. He was in normal sinus rhythm and his chest xray showed
a small pleural effusion with stable bilateral apical
pneumothoraces. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], his
cardiologist and his primary care physician as an outpatient.
All follow up appointments were advised.
