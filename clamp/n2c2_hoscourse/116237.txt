2. Mantle Cell Lymphoma:  Received 300mg/m2 of Cytoxan twice a
day for six doses, with high-dose Decadron.  The decadron was
discontinued after the patient developed psychotic paranoia.
She developed tumor lysis syndrome with elevated uric acid, and
initially requiring CVVH.  Her counts dropped in response to
chemotherapy and she was neutropenic for several days.  The
patient was treated with neupogen until her counts normalized,
and she remained afebrile.  Her effusions (below) continued to
re-accumulate after taps, and ultimately the decision was made
to treat the patient with the first round of R-CHOP.  She
tolerated the regimen very well, and had no issues completing
the prednisone portion of the therapy.  The patient was
transfused to keep her hematocrit above 25 and platelets above
10.
.
3. Malignant effusion:  The patient originally presented with
shortness of breath from a right pleural effusion and ascites.
Her ascites fluid was drained in the operating room, and not
sent for studies.  Her right pleural effusion was tapped twice,
both large volume.  Cytology was positive for lymphoma.  The
patient had reaccumulation of both fluid collections, which were
unintervenable while she was neutropenic.  Once her counts
recovered, the patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis of 3
liters, which demonstrated malignant cells.  The patient
remained short of breath after this procedure and underwent a
1.6 liter thoracentesis by interventional pulmonary.  She
tolerated the procedure well with immediate symptomatic
improvement. On a post-procedure x-ray, however, her right lung
remained [**Last Name (un) 57454**]-out. She underwent CTA which demostrated a very
large right pleural effusion with right lung collapse.  The
patient, however, had an improvement in her symptoms and
decrease in her oxygen requirement.  She underwent R-CHOP in an
effort to treat the underlying cause of her effusions.  She was
discharged on 40 po Lasix to take daily, to which she responded
well in the hospital.
.
4. s/p TAH-BSO: The patient was originally thought to have
ovarian cancer, and she underwent TAH-BSO on [**2107-11-1**].  The
diagnosis of lymphoma was made on an intraoperative lymph node
biopsy.  Her ovarian pathology was cystadenofibroma.
.
5. Cardiomyopathy: In the ICU, her ejection fraction was found
to be 20%, which is likely ischemic in origin from "shocked"
myocardium.  Repeat TTE, when her critical illness resolved
revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, but persistent right sided
failure. Prior to beginning treatment with R-CHOP, the patient
again had an echocardiogram which demonstrated resolution of the
right heart failure and 2+ MR.
.
6.  ID:  the patient had asymptomatic pyruia on [**11-14**], and was
treated for 7 days with Zosyn for a Citrobacter UTI.  Repeat
urine culture was negative.  She remained afebrile while
neutropenic.
.
7. Chronic back pain: MRI demonstrated no spinal or vertebral
involvement of her lymphoma.  She was maintained on narcotics
for pain control.  As her ascites reaccumulated, her pain
medication requirement increased.  She was discharged on 10 mg
Oxycontin [**Hospital1 **] and 5 mg Oxycodone q4 prn.  MRI revealed no spinal
involvement of her lymphoma
.
8. Disposition: The patient will go to rehabilitation to assist
her after her prolonged hospitalization and very low functional
status at this point.  Patient had a port placed by surgery on
[**2107-11-17**], which was functional through the hospitalization.  She
was full code.
