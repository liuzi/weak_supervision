Ms. [**Known lastname 97533**] arrived to the ED intubated for airway protection.
She recieved Profiline 9 and several units of FFp to reverse her
coagulopathy and went emergently for a left sided craniotomy for
SDH evacuation. Post operatively she was left intubated and
transferred to the Surgical intensive care unit.

Her exam never improved.  She was followed clinically for the
next few days.  An MRI was performed for prognostics.  She was
made CMO after a family meeting.  She later expired.
