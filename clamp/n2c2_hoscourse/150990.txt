67 year old female with SLE, DMI, HTN, ESRD on HD, paroxysmal
afib s/p PV isolation x2, tachy-brady syndrome s/p pacer, PVD
with SFA stent placement, and NSTEMI s/p DES to LAD and BMS to
OM1 on [**2148-6-21**] on aspirin, plavix, and coumadin who presented
with melena and BRBPR.
.
# GIB: Patient presented with melena and BRBPR, suspicious for
either an upper or lower GI source. The EGD showed mild
gastritis but no active bleeding. The flex sig was also negative
for active bleeding. The tagged RBC scan was positive in the
hepatic flexure, however when she was taken to IR for a
mesenteric angiogram, there was no active bleeding. She
continued to have melena so underwent an abdominal CTA (after
prep for her iodine allergy), which was also negative for active
bleeding. She was scheduled for a colonoscopy which was then
cancelled due to her Afib with RVR (see below). Overall she
received 8 units of PRBCs, 3 units of FFP, and 1 unit of
platelets while in the ICU.  It was determined by the team that
the colonoscopy can be deferred to the outpatient setting given
her relative stability.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: S/p two ablations in the past, now with
pacemaker. We continued her amiodarone but initially held her
home metoprolol and diltizem in the setting of the GIB. She went
into AFib with RVR on MICU day #3 so she was given IV diltiazem
and metoprolol and her home metoprolol and diltiazem were
restarted. However, she continued to have RVR and required a
diltiazem gtt.  She was eventually transitioned to her home
doses.
.
# ESRD: On Tues/Thurs/Sat dialysis schedule, which was continued
in the MICU.
.
# CAD: Patient with NSTEMI one week ago s/p DES to LAD and BMS
to OM1. We continued aspirin/plavix despite the GIB given risk
for in-stent thrombosis one week out. This was discussed with
her [**Date Range **] outpatient cardiologist.
.
# PVD s/p SFA stenting recently: Recent peripheral angiogram by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3407**] with angioplasty/stenting of the left SFA and
angioplasty of the left tibial artery; had been on plavix prior
to NSTEMI. She has 2 gangrenous toes, which appear similar to
prior. Continued aspirin/Plavix.
.
# Chronic pain: Continued home gabapentin and dilaudid.
.
# Depression: Continued sertraline.

# Goals of Care: Patient expressing interest in rethinking her
goals of care.  She is considering a do not hospitalize, but
would like to talk things over with her family before making
these decisions.  She will speak to her primary care doctor, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1057**], about these issues. She had declined rehab while in the
MICU and was very insistent on going home. Because she had good
family support and very good insight into her condition, she was
discharged home with close follow up by the MICU team. She felt
weak at home and was not able to navigate her home as well as
she would have liked. The [**Last Name (STitle) 2287**] case managers arranged for her
to go to [**Hospital 1785**] Rehab from home the day after admission. The
MICU team was in communication with the case manager and primary
care doctor during the post-discharge period in order to
faciliatate a proper disposition. There is a separate note in
OMR detailing this.
