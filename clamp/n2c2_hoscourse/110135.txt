#MRSA sepsis:  Pt was admitted to the MICU and started on
vancomycin and zosyn for antibiotic coverage.  Once
sensitivities returned as MRSA, the zosyn was discontinued.  Her
blood pressures were low on initial presentation so the patient
was given bolus IV fluids and levophed.  Her CVP was maintained
above 8.  She was eventually weaned off of the levophed.  An
extensive workup for the source of infection was limited by
patient's wishes.  She had a TTE which was negative but refused
an MRI of the spine.  The patient was afebrile during the ICU
course.  Surveillance cultures were negative after [**2114-11-14**].
She will receive long duration therapy with 6wks of Vancomycin
to cover for osteomyelitis, as she has had this in the past.
Her most recent vanco level was pending at time of discharge.
.
#Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia:  The patients platlet count
continued to fall during her ICU stay.  Heparin products were
held and sent off HIT Ab labs which eventually came back
positive.  Her central line was also discontinued which was
pre-treated with heparin.
.
#ESRD:  The patient has ESRD and received dialysis through her
fistula while in the MICU.  No complications.  Last dialysis was
on [**2114-11-22**].  Pt required extra sessions of dialysis because of
HD-related hypotension, which limited the extent of dialysis
that could be done in one session. She was started on EPO
4000units with dialysis for CKD-related anemia.
.
#CAD: continue pt's BB and plavix. allergy to asa and ace.
.
#Chronic back pain w/ spinal stenosis: continue outpt morphine
SR 30 qMon-Wed-Fri, and IR 15 q6h prn, as well as lidoderm
patch. pt appears to be at her baseline back pain, however we
wanted to do an MRI to rule out osteomyletis or epidural abscess
but the patient refused.

#[**Female First Name (un) 564**] UTI: Ms [**Known lastname 349**] had [**Female First Name (un) **] in her urine and was
started on a 7d course of fluconazole 200mg daily.  This will
completed on [**2114-11-22**]. She does not have a foley catheter and
makes 20-30cc urine/day.
