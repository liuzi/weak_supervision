Ms. [**Known lastname 18573**] is a 63F w/ recurrent stage IIIC papillary
serous ovarian CA on cycle 8 day 14 of carboplatin, gemcitabine,
bevacizumab (avastin), and b/l hydronephrosis [**3-8**] ureter
obstruction requiring left ureteral stent and right nephrostomy
tube. She p/w acute onset SOB in the setting of one week of
dyspnea and fatigue, which was initially concerning for PE.
Further w/u ended up ruling out PE, and her SOB was likely in
the context of her fever and GNR bacteremia, which were likely
[**3-8**] urinary source.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Dyspnea: Pt p/w acute onset SOB, and was found to be in sinus
tach with elevated d-dimer and BNP in setting of malignancy,
although bedside u/s showed no e/o R heart strain. She did not
undergo CTA due to elevated Cr, but was started on a heparin gtt
in the ED. Upon admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she had no Si/Sx of
hemodynamic or respiratory collapse. ACS, PNA or pulmonary edema
were r/o. LENIs were obtained, which were negative. A VQ scan
was subsequently performed, and it was low probability for PE
and the heparin was d/c'd. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] her SOB vastly improved
without further intervention. Her dyspnea was most likely due to
her anemia as she significantly improved after transfusion of 2
units pRBCs for a HCT of 18.
.
# Fevers and UTI: UTI was likely cause for her fevers to 102.3
and diff with 91% PMNs. Pt has a h/o b/l hydronephrosis [**3-8**]
ureter obstruction requiring left ureteral stent and right
nephrostomy tube, and all UA's have been positive with pyuria
and hematuria since [**2-15**]. Upon admission, she again had positive
UA's from both foley and nephrostomy tube. She received
vanc/cefepime in the ED; her past urine Cx's have grown E coli
sensitive to cefepime. Per past urology notes, her R kidney is
not functioning as well as the left, and no other urological
interventions were necessary; she is scheduled for a left stent
change in [**7-17**].
While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], GNRs grew out of her blood Cx from [**6-16**], and
she was continued on cefepime (d1=[**6-16**]), and continued on vanc
(d1=[**6-16**]) given that she has a port. Her urine culture grew coag
+ staph and per Urology, it was recommended to continue treating
the UTI w/o indication for stent removal at this time. Her urine
culture eventually speciated as pansensitive staphylococcus
aureus, and she was transitioned to oral augmentin to compelte a
total 14 day course following discharge.  Her blood cultures
speciated as pansensitive E. coli and she was transitined to
oral ciprofloxacin, also to complete a 14 day course, priro to
dishcarge.  She remained afebrile and stable on oral antibiotics
for 24 hours prior to discharge.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Baseline Cr is about 1.2-1.3; pt initially p/w Cr 1.9.
Likely prerenal etiology given fever and UTI and FeNa of 0.9%.
She has a h/o obstruction, but had been maintaining good UOP
from urethra and nephrostomy. Her Cr improved in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to 1.4
after 2 units pRBCs, and subsequently improved further to 1.2 by
the time of discharge.
.
# Anemia: Macrocytic anemia with Hct 24.9 and MCV 102 on
admission; baseline Hct is in high 20's. She had no Si/Sx of
active bleeding upon admission, although the pt endorses small
amts of blood in stool while on avastin, known to heme-onc. She
had a 6-point Hct drop after admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with no
identified source; her Hct bumped appropriately after 2U PRBC's.
Her stool was guaiac negative.
.
CHRONIC OR INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Most likely [**3-8**] chemo per her primary
oncologist, as per hx of similar s/p chemo and is unlikely HIT
as her platelets were decreased upon admission and before the
initiation of the heparin gtt.
.
# Recurrent stage IIIC papillary serous ovarian CA on cycle 8
day 14 of carboplatin, gemcitabine, bevacizumab (avastin).
.
# HTN: initially held home lisinopril 5mg daily given fevers,
UTI, and [**Last Name (un) **]. Once her creatinine decreased to 1.4, her home
lisinopril was re-started.
