78 yo male with distant history of stable angina, new diagnosis
of acute promyelocytic leukemia, transferred to the ICU with
tachycardia after ATRA treatment on the hematology malignancy
floor, with DIC, pulmonary edema, and delirium.
.
# APML: He was diagnosed with APML with 56% blasts on
differential [**2174-3-18**]. He was treated with ATRA and subsequently
suffered from ATRA syndrome with an acute elevation in his WBC
to >50 K. He had significant pulmonary leak. He was treated with
ATRA throughout and received Idarubicin which had to be stopped
secondary to elevated bilirubin. His blasts and WBC subsequently
decreased, and on smear [**2174-4-4**] his myelocytes showed
differentiation with improving status of his leukemia. ATRA was
continued throughout his hospitalization. As a consequence of
treatment, his course was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome
with his uric acid peaking above 10, with a change an increase
in creatinine to 2.5 initially and subsequently higher as
described below. He was treated with allopurinol initially, and
required a 1x dose of Rasburicase which led to the resolution of
his TLS. He was maintained on his allopurinol for continued
treatment.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial in the setting of
pulmonary leak from ATRA and likely alveolar hemorrhage. His
fluid balance reached a peak of 27L positive secondary to his
blood product requirement. He initially required a PEEP of 22
with FiO2 of 100%. Over the course of 10 days he was able to be
weaned down with the assistance of CVVH for fluid overload to
pressure support of [**5-19**]. His mental status was the largest
obstacle to extubation and he was taken for tracheotomy tube
placement by Thoracic Surgery on [**2174-4-8**]. He tolerated the
procedure well, and was able to be transitioned to trach collar
starting on [**2174-4-10**] for periods of time.
.
# DIC: Due to his APML, he developed DIC evidenced by active
bleeding from his ET tube, his OG tube, his stool and urine. He
had acute drops in fibrinogen, increase in LDH and increase in
bilirubin. He was supported through this with massive
transfustions requiring 18 units of PRBCs, 35 units of
platelets, 5 units of FFP, and 24 units of cryoprecipitate. He
was intubated due hypoxia and increased work of breathing on
[**2174-3-26**]. His CXR after intubation showed a fluffy infiltrate
suggestive of either ARDS or hemorrhage (likely both). Due to
his subdural hematomas, he was transfused to goals of Hct>30,
plts > 100, fibrinogen > 175, and INR <1.6. Once the DIC
resolved, his goals changed to Hct>25, plts > 20, fibrinogen >
100, and INR <1.6.
.
# Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy: He started experiencing a
decline in mental status 2 days prior to intubation with severe
asterixis and confusion. He had a number of potential causes
such as medications, central focus with his SDH, and
hypertension to 180 making PRES a less likely, but possible
concern. Also, his uremia given his acute renal failure. He
required several doses of Haldol and intermittent restraints for
safety prior to intubation, when he was put on midazolam and
Fentanyl drips. 5 days after intubation his was sedation was
discontinued and he remained obtunded. He was treated with
dialysis for a uremia over 200. His mental status was the
barrier to extubation as his vent setting were minimal at the
point of weaning sedation. He was non responsive after 4 days
off of sedation. A family meeting was held with his husband
[**Name (NI) **], and the decision was made to take him to trach, with the
goal of trying to improve his mental status with dialysis.

# Acute renal failure: His creatinine sharply rose from 1.2 on
admission to a peak of 4.9. This was thought to be in the
setting of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) and abdominal compartment
syndrome. Also complicated by ATN in the setting of low blood
volume and possible microthrombi during DIC. He was treated
allopurinol and Rasburicase for TLS with good resolution as well
as with CVVH initially (1 day) for fluid removal. His urine
output responded. Shortly after he began autodiuresing He was
initiated on dialysis for AMS as described above and a BUN of
greater than 200. He was treated with dialysis with a fall in
BUN to 113, however, he had a fever to 100.6 and cultures came
back positive for GPC in chains from dialysis catheter [**2174-4-9**].
.
# Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: In the setting of acute volume
overload from large volume transfusions given DIC as above. He
was ~25L positive for LOS fluid balance. He developed elevated
bladder pressures and decreased urine output. Surgery was
consulted and felt that as long as he was making urine there was
no need for surgical intervention (as well as given his critical
illness, it was not indicated). He was started on CVVH as above
and had 3L removed. His kidneys responded and began making
100-200cc/hr of urine. His CVVH was stopped and he was allowed
to diurese on his own with support of lasix and metolazone as
needed.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation / Flutter: He developed tachycardia to the
140s with initial EKG most consistent with Afib, and later EKG
more consistent with Aflutter vs AVNRT.  His HR did not respond
to Diltiazem drip or multiple subsequent IV boluses of Diltiazem
and Metoprolol.  Cardiology suggested Verapamil, followed by
Amiodarone.  He was loaded with Amiodarone drip and bolus of 150
mg x2.  He was cardioverted on [**2174-3-22**] and continued on
Amiodarone.  He got an extra 150mg of amiodarone on [**3-25**] with
minimal effect on tachycardia. He converted to NSR, and reverted
back to atrial fibrillation. In the setting of controlling his
blood pressure with IV medications he received multiple doses of
metoprolol and labetalol, and he converted to NSR. However, [**4-1**]
he converted back to rapid a-fib with RVR and required
uptitration of his B-blockade and a diltiazem drip which was
eventually converted back to PO.
.
# Bilateral Subdural Hematomas: Unclear time course.
Neurosurgery followed along and he had serial scans. His
hematomas had interval increased in the setting of the DIC;
however, not thought to be clinically significant. Neurosurgery
preferred medical management with antiepileptics and reversal of
his coagulopathy.
.
# Right basal ganglia infarct: On repeat scan of his head to
evaluate interval change of his subdural hematomas on [**2174-4-4**], a
new right sided basal ganglia infarct was noted. Neurosurgery
followed, and neurology was consulted. They felt that medical
management and blood pressure control were the best means of
treatment.
.
# Positive Blood Cultures: Blood cultures were positive in [**2-16**]
bottles from his PICC line on [**2174-3-22**].  The aerobic culture was
speciated as Staph aureus.  No peripheral culture was obtained
on that date.  He was started on Vancomycin / Meropenem on
[**2174-3-22**] after spiking a fever to 102.5.  This was changed to
Vancomycin / Cefepime the next day.  Given the concern for
translocation of gut bacteria with his compromised immune
system, he was switched to Vancomycin / Zosyn on [**2174-3-24**] for
better coverage of gut pathogens.  Micafungin was added to cover
for fungal pathogens. He had multiple sets of negative
surveillance cultures, and his antibiotics were continued while
he remained neutropenic. He had a fever to 100.6 on [**2174-4-9**] and
cultures were drawn from his dialysis catheter which were
positive for GPCs in chains. His catheter was pulled and he was
continued on vancomycin.
.
# Pericardial Fat Pad: On echo on [**2174-3-24**] there was concern for
pericardial effusion because the echo showed a new anterior
pericardial effusion with complex echodensity.  No evidence of
tamponade physiology was seen on the echo.  His repeat echo
showed that the effusion was actually a fat pad.
.
# Alcoholism/Cirrhosis: He was known to drink a bottle of
alcohol per night. He initially required 10 mg IV diazepam
several times and started on a CIWA scale.  On RUQ imaging for
persistent elevation of his bilirubin, cirrhosis was noted. More
than likely his cirrhosis was secondary to alcoholism and he had
poor clearance of his bilirubin (from reabsorption from pooled
blood).
.
# Elevated Glucose: He initially had glucose's in the 400??????s in
the setting of getting steroids. His insulin coverage was
briefly switched to an insulin drip, and he was subsequently
converted to subcutaneous insulin based on his requirements.

# Goals of care: Pt remained in coma. His overall clinical
status continued to decline over the course of hospitalization,
with evolution of multi-system organ failure including increased
pulmonary ventilatory requirements, persistant renal failure,
LFTs continued to increase and he developed recurrent bacteremia
(initially MSSA, then VRE). He was given 1 dose of daptomycin
for VRE coverage. Given his multiple organ failure, worsening
ventilatory requirements and persistent altered mental status, a
family meeting was held and decision made to focus efforts on
patient comfort beginning [**2174-4-12**] AM. The patient quietly
expired on [**2174-4-14**] with family at the bedside.
