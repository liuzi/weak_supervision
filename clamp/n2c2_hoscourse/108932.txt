The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service with
duodenal perforation status post ERCP. The patient was made NPO
with NGT, started on IV fluids and IV Zosyn, and Dilaudid PCA
for pain control. CT scan on HD # 2 demonstrated large amount of
fluid in the right anterior and posterior pararenal spaces
tracking down to the lower quadrant of the abdomen and large
amount of free air. Nutritional consult was called for TPN
recommendations and PICC line was placed. The patient continued
to spike low grade fever and her blood cultures were positive
for STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS, Vancomycin Iv was added on HD #
6. Repeat abdominal CT demonstrated  decreased but persistent
large intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal free  air with a large
amount of fluid in the right retroperitoneum is seen with
anterior displacement of the right kidney. The patient continued
to spike fever and IR drainage of the right retroperitoneal
fluid collection was ordered. The patient underwent CT-guided
percutaneous drainage catheter placement into the right
perinephric space on HD # 6 and fluid was sent for cultures. The
patient's diet was advanced as tolerated on POD # 8, and was
well tolerated. The cultures were positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans
and IV Fluconazole was added. Despite antibiotics treatment
patient continued to spike fever and her abdominal pain was
continued to be significantly high requiring large amount of IV
Dilaudid, Ativan and Ketorolac to manage it, patient's WBC also
continued to increased (16->38).Repeat abdominal CT scan on HD #
10 revealed slight decrease in fluid component of right
perinephric collection, extensive multi loculated phlegmonous
change with no significant large fluid component to target for
drainage and persistent extensive free intra-abdominal air with
multiple pockets of air  surrounding the second part of
duodenum. The decision was made to take the patient in OR for
washout.
On [**2112-3-20**], the patient underwent wide incision and drainage of
retroperitoneal
abscess/infection/hematoma, [**Location (un) **] patch of potential duodenal
perforation region
with drainage and antecolic isoperistaltic side-to-side
gastrojejunostomy and JP drains placement x 4, which went well
without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). Intraoperatively patient received 2 units of pRBC, she
was extubated post op and was transferred in ICU for
observation. On POD # 2, patient received 2 units of pRBC for
HCT 23.4, her post transfusion Hct was 28.3. The patient was
transferred to the floor on POD # 3, NPO on TPN and IV fluids,
and Dilaudid PCA for pain control. The patient was continued to
have low grade fever and she was continued on IV Vancomycin,
Zosyn and Fluconazole. The patient was hydrodynamically stable.
