Admitted same day surgery and was brought to the operating room
for coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Please see operative
report for surgical details. He received cefazolin for
perioperative antibiotics and was transferred to the intensive
care unit for post operative management.  That evening he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was
extubated without complications.  On post-op day one he was
started on beta-blockers, diuretics and metformin. Later that
day he was transferred to the floor.  Physical therapy worked
with him on strength and mobility.  On post operative day two he
had episodes of nausea treated with antiemtics and then short
episode of confusion so his narcotics were stopped and he was
placed on ultram for pain management with good effect.  Due to
increased creatinine to 2.1 his lasix and metformin were
stopped, and lantus was increased for blood glucose management.
Over the next few days his creatinine peaked at 2.3 on [**6-6**] and
trended down to 1.7 at discharge.  He was resumed on lasix for
diuresiss with lower extremity edema.  Additionally he had
decreased hematocrit requiring transfusions, and restarted on
home iron.  Hematocrits were trended daily and they remained
stable.  Also his white blood cell count dropped but no fever
and differential was normal, he was pan cultured and to date
only grew on gram negative rods from sputum and was placed on
levaquin.  He continued to improve and was ready for discharge
to rehab on post operative day six to Newbridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **]
with plan for follow up wound check next week for evaluation of
right leg.
