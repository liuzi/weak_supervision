Mr. [**Known lastname 1794**] is a 65 year-old man with h/o recent hospitalization
and MICU stay for bilateral pulmonary embolism complicated by
spontaneous intra-hepatic hemorrhage presenting on this
admission with RLE pain and numbness found to have full length
RLE DVT.
.
# Right Lower Extremity DVT:  Patient with history of recent b/l
PE, complicated by intra-hepatic hematoma on anticoagulation.
Patient discharged home on recent prior admission with IVC
filter, not on anticoagulation.  On this admission, patient
found to have a large RLE DVT.  Patient with palpable peripheral
pulses bilaterally.  Evaluated by vascular surgery in ED, who
felt that his RLE was non-threatened and no surgical
intervention was required.  Given the risk of extension of DVT
to the point where vascular compromise could be reached, as well
as the risk of further extending PEs, we cautiously
anticoagulated the patient with careful monitoring for fear that
the pt would patient have another hepatic bleed. Patient was
admitted to ICU and anticoagulation was started with heparin gtt
with goal of 60 - 80.  Patient reached the therapeutic level and
his HCT remained stable.  Serial vascular exams were stable.
The RLE was elevated and wrapped in ACE.  He was then sent to
the regular medicine floor.  However, unfortunately he then had
his platelets drop, and was found to have heparin induced
thrombocytopenia (see below), and was transitioned to argatroban
for his DVT.  He was then transitioned to coumadin prior to D/C.
 His INR was 4.0 on day of discharge, and he was instructed to
follow up with his PCP for further monitoring of his INR with a
goal of between [**2-3**].
.
# Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia: Patient's platelets dropped
from 247 on [**5-11**] to 118 on [**2185-5-14**], which normally would not fit
with the traditional window for HIT, but pt had received heparin
on his prior admission also.  Hematology was consulted, and
recommended switching to argatroban, which we did.  Patient's
PF4 test was sent, and returned with an optical density of 2.7,
so the lab cancelled our serotonin release assay as the PF4 was
considered positive enough.  Patient was instructed to get a
heparin allergy bracelet with help from his PCP.
.
#  Recent subcapsular hepatic bleed: Patient with recent ICU
stay requiring massive transfusion protocol following
spontaneous subcapsular hepatic bleed while on anticoagulation.
Patient discharged home from prior admission on no
anti-coagulation.  For this admission, imaging showed that his
liver hematoma had a stable appearance.  Surgery was consulted
in the ED and recommended no surgical intervention at this time.
 Surgery recommended supportive care should the bleed recur, but
patient remained with stable VSs and no RUQ abdominal pain.
.
# Bilateral pulmonary embolism: Patient initially presented with
left sided chest and flank pain when admitted in [**2185-4-1**].
The etiology of emboli is unclear - patient was discharged with
plan for outpatient hypercoagulable work-up.  Patient discharged
with IVC filter, not on anti-coagulation.  Concern for extension
of pulmonary embolism on this admission as clot extended
proximally above IVC filter.  Patient remained mildly
tachycardiac throughout the admission, but not hypoxic, dyspnic,
and did not have chest pain.  Patient's PE's were treated with
argatroban when his DVT was treated with argatroban.  HIT may
have contributed to extension of clots above IVC filter.
Patient will need outpatient anticoagulation w/u, but this is
complicated by the fact that he is now on coumadin for at least
6 months.
.
# h/o [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease: Previously followed by Endocrine at [**Hospital1 18**].
Per patient not receiving any treatment. Denies symptoms or
hyper/hypothyroid at this time.  TSH was wnl therefore no
intervention undertaken.
.
# Hypertension: Patient with history of hypertension, and was
hypertensive on admission. Patient had not been taking
lisinopril since discharge.  Lisinopril was held in the ICU
while anticoagulating given bleeding risk, and patient remained
normotensive there as well as when transferred to the floor.
Therefore, we did not restart pt's lisinopril at dispo and
instructed him to f/u with his PCP.
.
# Dyslipidemia: Simvastatin 10mg qhs held after last admission
as patient had transaminitis likely [**2-2**] subcapsular liver bleed.
 LFTs were wnl.  Therefore we restarted simvastatin on this
admission.
