The patient is an 88-year-old [**Location 7972**] woman with
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, known AAA (4.4x4.1cm), AV
nodal disease s/p pacemaker placement, PVD and AS with valve
area 0.81, who presents after diagnostic right- and left- heart
catheterization with a hypotensive episode in the setting of
multiple antihypertensive agents, 2 liter autodiuresis, and
severe abdominal pain.
.
#. Hypotensive episode - The patient experienced hypotension
post-catheterization, likely from a combination of receiving
multiple anti-hypertensives within a short amount of time
(metoprolol, nitroglycerin, and hydralazine), with a
large-volume auto-diuresis, and likely a component of vasovagal
response in the setting of severe abdominal pain. She received
approx 1.5L of volume resuscitation and her anti-hypertensives
were held. She did well clinically thereafter, with good
response in her blood pressure. Her beta-blocker was resumed at
home dose on [**2180-2-26**], which she tolerated well, and she was
started on a low-dose ACE-inhibitor as well, which she also
tolerated well. Her HCTZ was held and was not restarted. She was
discharged on [**2180-2-26**] with follow-up planned with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
in 2 weeks.
.
#. Coronary Artery Disease (ischemia) - The patient had no
significant CAD on her left-heart catheterization, and she had
no signs of active ischemia. She was maintained on her home baby
aspirin for primary prophylaxis.
.
#. Pump - The patient has a preserved EF on her most recent TTE,
with no signs of CHF currenty. She is pre-load dependent given
her valvular disease.
.
#. Rhythm - The patient has a history of high-degree AV nodal
disease s/p recent pacemaker placement. She currently has a
paced rhythm.
.
#. Valves - The patient has known severe AS with valve area 0.8.
She will have outpatient follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for further
management of her valvular disease.
.
#. Hypertension - The patient's home anti-hypertensives, HCTZ
and metoprolol, were initially held given her hypotensive
episode above. The metoprolol was re-instituted as the patient's
blood pressures improved, and she was also started on an
ACE-inhibitor prior to discharge. Her HCTZ was discontinued.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia - The patient was continued on her home
cholestyramine and Lescol.
.
#. Vascular Aneurysms - The patient has known AAA (4.3cm),
ascending thoracic aneurysm (3.5cm), and right proximal
popliteal aneurysm, all of which are followed as an outpatient.
.
#. Peripheral Vascular Disease - The patient has PVD s/p
bilateral lower extremity revascularization. She was continued
on her home baby aspirin.
