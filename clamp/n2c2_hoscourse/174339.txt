The patient was admitted on [**2200-2-14**] to the neurosurgery service
after a mental status change at the nursing home. He was
admitted with a presumed SDH on the CT scan. However, the
patient had an MRI which revealed a mass resembling a
meningioma. There was no hemorrhage there. The patient was
transferred out of the ICU on [**2200-2-18**].
He was evaluated by PT and a speech/swallowing therapist. PT
felt that he was safe to be discharged back the his nursing home
on [**2200-2-19**]. On [**2-19**] he was also able to take in thin liquids and
pureed solids without difficulty.

He had his foley catheter removed on [**2-18**] but had urinary
retention. A Coud?????? catheter was placed that night and he was
discharged with it in place. Flomax was started as well and
bladder training was begun. He may be able to have it removed in
a day or so at the nursing home. The patient should follow up
with a urologist.

The patient was made DNR/DNI in the hospital by his health care
proxy as well as for the ambulance ride. Palliative care and
medical consults were obtained to assist in management of the
patient. His medications were optimized due to his mental status
changes. Additionally a family meeting with all 3 teams
occurred. It was felt that surgery would not benefit the patient
and that quality of life was important. We all agreed that being
at the nursing home with his wife would be the best for him at
this time. The nursing home staff may want to consider a "Do not
hospitalize" policy with this patient and his health care proxy.
