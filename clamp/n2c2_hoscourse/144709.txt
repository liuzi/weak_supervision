[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 39033**] is a 67-year-old woman with recurrent, stage IC,
grade 3 endometrial cancer metastatic to multiple sites
including the C spine C2-5 and lung, s/p XRT to pelvis and C
spine, who presents with right arm and leg weakness following a
fall on [**10-20**]. MRI of the C spine revealed worsened C3 cord
compression.  Radiation oncology felt that additional radiation
therapy would not be of benefit, and neurosurgery was consulted
in view of progressive cord compression precipitated by recent
neck trauma.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from Neurosurgery and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] from Neuro-oncology
felt that an operation to debulk cervical spine tumor and
stabilize the C-spine was reasonable under the circumstances.
The risks and potential benefits were explained to the patient
and her husband, and she was interested in proceeding with
surgery.  She operated on [**2112-10-28**] for posterior C3, partial
C2-4 Laminectomies with occiput C1-5-6 plates and screws, Halo,
and general surgery placed a tracheostomy at the same day.
Immediate postop patient was opening eyes to voice, following
commands, moves left upper and lower extremity purposefully, no
movement on the right upper extremity, slight movement on the
right lower extremity to noxious stimuli.  She remained in the
PACU overnight and was eventually transferred to the neuro
step-down unit for close monitoring. PICC line placed for
parenteral nutrition and dexamethasone weaned.  On [**2112-10-30**] her
oxygen saturation decreased, chest radiograph showed increased
left sided opacification and large pleural effusion.  A CTA of
the chest revealed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli
involving the pulmonary arterial branches supplying the left
lower lobe. Patient started on heparin gtt for anticoagulation
and then transferred to Neuro-ICU.

Infectious disease was consulted on [**2112-10-31**] and continued to
follow her throughout her hospital stay.  In the setting of PE
Vascular surgery consulted for IVC filter. Prior to IVC filter
placement, a bilateral lower extremity Doppler study showed no
evidence of DVT.

The patient's affect appeared to change over time, and she
became less communicative and more withdrawn, despite being
alert.  Given her complicated disease course and understandable
emotional/physical stress, a psychiatry consult was obtained.
Psychiatry recommended continuing lorazepam for anxiety/sleep,
and ongoing support for family.  If a clearer picture of
depression emerged, they would consider an antidepressant.

[**2112-11-4**] patient underwent an anterior corpectomy C3-4-5-6 with
allograft, as a planned second step in an attempt to stabilize
her cervical spine.  Heparin drip was resumed 48 hours after the
surgery, as well as Dexamethasone 4mg every 6 hours for 48 then
gradually tapered to off. Postoperatively her neuro exam has
been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**], and the patient was inconsistently
following commands.  On [**2112-11-9**] neuro exam; opens eyes to
voice, moves left upper and lower extremities to command.

ID reconsulted regarding cellulitis on the posterior wound site
started on Vancomycin and meropenem, discontinued ceftriaxone.
MRSA and VRE screen returned positive therefore contact
precaution [**Name2 (NI) 39036**]. Stool sent for C-diff which also came
back positive, and she started on Metronidazol for C-diff
coverage. Endocrine consulted for hyponatremia, started on
initailly to 1000ml/24 then 1500cc/24 fluid restriction, check
serum Na level twice a day and continued with sodium tabs via
NG-tube.

On [**2112-11-19**], the patient was transferred out of the ICU and back
to the OMED service. At that time, she was in a halo cast,
immobilized in bed, without good recovery of function on her
right side.  Given the extensive nature of her metastatic
disease, her poor performance status, and the low likelihood of
obtaining meaningful neurological recovery, the patient and her
husband expressed the desire that she be transferred to home
with hospice care.  Her chest tube was removed after
pleurodesis. Neurosurgery removed halo collar and placed hard
cervical collar. She will continue to be treated for her
pneumonia and c.diff colitis for two weeks. She will also
continue to receive tube feedings. Per the patients request, the
tracheostomy tube will be left in place. She has a known
pulmonary embolism and will continue to be treated with lovenox.
