On [**2165-12-18**], he underwent liver transplant. Surgeon as Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Induction immunosuppression was administered. Please
refer to operative note for complete details. Two JPs were
placed.  During dissection a small defect was made in the
diaphragm.  This was closed with a figure-of-eight silk suture
after evacuating the pneumothorax using a red rubber catheter
placed to suction. He did very well and was transferred to the
SICU postop for management. A CXR demonstrated a increased size
of right apical pneumothorax and right upper lobe collapse. A
chest tube was placed with improvement. Chest tube was removed
on [**12-21**]. Postop LFTs initially increased then trended down
daily. He remained hemodynamically stable. JP drains were
non-bilious. Postop, liver duplex showed patent vasculature and
no ductal dilatation.

He was transferred out of the SICU to the med-[**Doctor First Name **] unit where he
made daily progress. Diet was advanced and tolerated. He
required insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia secondary to
steroids. He became independent with ambulation. JPs were
removed. He did well with immunosuppression teaching. Steroids
were tapered per protocol. Cellcept was well tolerated. Prograf
was initiated on postop day 0. Trough levels were done daily
with dose adjustments. Prograf was increased to 9mg [**Hospital1 **] for a
trough of 5 on [**12-24**].

He experienced intractable hiccoughs as a result of the
diaphragm repair. He did receive a couple low doses of thorazine
with temporary relief.

Due to sulfa allergy, bactrim was not ordered for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. He received a Pentamidine inhalation treatment on
[**12-23**]. He also received a Pamidronate treatment on [**12-24**] for
osteopenia.

He was discharged home with instructions to check his blood
sugar prior to breakfast and supper. He will follow up in the
outpatient clinic on [**1-2**]. Labs will be drawn on [**12-26**].
