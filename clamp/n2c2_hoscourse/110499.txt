1. Anasarca: The patient appeared to be total body overloaded by
intravascularly dry at admission. She [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] right heart
catheterization on [**2126-12-6**] that showed pulmonary hypertension
(systolic BP 45, diastolic BP 20, mean BP 28). She was therefore
started on sildenafil. The nephrology service was consulted, and
she diuresed well on a regimen on albumin, lasix, and
chlorthiazide (then metolazone). Her diuresis was discontinued
on [**1-8**] because of development of hypotension occuring in the
setting of a urinary tract infection. Subsequently, she was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension (see below) where
sildenafil was d/c'd as the patient was unlikely benefiting from
it in the setting of relatively mild to moderate pulmonary HTN
and overall systemic hypotension.

2. UTI: She developed a urinary tract infection with Pseudomonas
on [**12-15**] and was treated with a two week course of levofloxacin
then ciprofloxacin. A repeat urine culture was obtained for
followup on [**1-2**] although she was afebrile and had no urinary
complaints. This culture again grew out Pseudomonas, this time
quinolone resistant. Her foley catheter was changed, as she
refused to have it removed. She subsequently developed a fever
to 101.3 on [**1-7**] and was started on cefepime, with addition of
vancomycin and flagyl on [**1-8**]. Upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
hypotension and tachycardia (see below), she was continued on
vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. A central venous line and
arterial line were placed under sterile conditions. After 24
hours in the ICU, the patient was on 3 pressors with the
differential diagnosis including septic vs. cardiogenic shock.
Meropenem was added as for double gram-negative and Psuedomonas
coverage. In spite of maximal medical therapy, the patient
remained maxed out on 3 pressors. A repeat family meeting was
held with the pt's HCP and mother, who agreed to make the
patient CMO. She expired shortly thereafter. An autospy was
offered, but declined.

3. Hypotension and tachycardia: She developed hypotension to the
70's sytolic on [**1-8**] which responded initially to fluid boluses.
Her hypotension was thought to reflect both aggressive diuresis
and possible urosepsis. She developed tachycardia to the 120's
on [**1-9**] with a new RBBB. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where
she was given adenosine 6 mg X 2 with conversion to sinus
tachycaria after the second dose of adenosine. However, she went
back into a wide complex tachycardia with a RBBB pattern soon
thereafter. The cardiology team evaluated her and felt that this
rhythm was most likely an SVT with rate related aberancy;
however the following day, after reviewing the EKG strips with
the EP attending, the patient was determined to have a fasicular
ventricular tachycardia in the setting of no known prior CAD or
ischemic scar. The treatment of choice in this setting would
have been verapimil; however this was not feasible as the
patient was already on 3 pressors (neo, levophed, and
vasopressin). The following day, a dose of verapimil was tried
given concern for possibly worsening cardiogenic shock (however
the patient's extremities remained warm to palpation, which
suggested likely septic shock) with conversion back to sinus
tachycardia. She was not cardioverted secondary to the patient's
wishes to remain DNR/DNI. Given the patient's lack of
improvement in spite of maximal medical care, the patient was
made CMO after another family meeting and expired shortly
thereafter.

3. C. diff colitis: She experienced loose stools after admission
and a stool sample was positive for C. diff toxin on [**12-8**]; she
was subsequently treated with a 14 day course of flagyl. This
was restarted on [**1-8**] as noted above in the context of recurrent
fever and increased stooling.

4. Right basilic vein thrombosis: The patient's PICC line was
removed and she was started on IV heparin and then coumadin. Her
anticoagulation was discontinued in the setting of heme positive
stools and widely varying INR (thought likely to be due to
interactions with her many medications). A repeat ultrasound of
the upper extremity showed no evidence of persistent thrombus
therefore she was not continued on further anticoagulation.

5. AML with history of GVHD: She was continued on cyclosporine,
Cellcept, and her prednisone was titrated down per BMT
recommendations.

6. Elevated LFTs: Her transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and
bilirubin were moderately elevated and thought to be secondary
to GVHD of the liver after review of her medication list and
right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no other clear causes
of these findings. Her alkaline phosphatase elevation was
probably due at least in part to her bony disease as the bone
specific fraction was elevated as well.

7. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine was 1.3 at
admission peaking at 1.9. She was thought to be intravascularly
dry with prerenal failure. Her creatinine improved with addition
of albumin to her diuretic regimen consistent with this.

8. Pulmonary hypertension: Ms. [**Known lastname 28331**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] right heart
catheterization on [**12-7**] to assess whether pulmonary
hypertension might be contributing to her significant edema.
This study showed mean pulmonary pressures of 28 and she was
subsequently started on sildenafil, which was subsequently d/c'd
upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (see above).

9. Heme positive stools: As noted above, she had heme positive
stools in the setting of anticoagulation with IV heparin and
warfarin and recent C. difficile colitis infectoin. In addition,
she had a prior history of gastritis on endoscopy and was
receiving steroids for her GVHD. She was started on a PPI and
her Hct was followed closely.

10. Hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency: The patient's
PTH was rechecked as the differential for her bone changes noted
on plain films included osteitis fibrosa. She was evaluated by
the endocrinology consult service who felt that her
hyperparathyroidism was likely secondary, perhaps due to renal
failure or steroid use. Her vitamin D levels were rechecked and
found to be low. She was started on weekly vitamin D and daily
calcium. She will need repeat vitamin D studies and should
follow up with endocrinology for further management. She was
started on a bisphosphonate per endocrine recs.

11. Pulmonary osteoarthropathy: She complained of diffuse body
pains and aches. Imaging of her extremities was notable for
diffuse periosteal reaction. The endocrinology service reviewed
the films and felt the history and imaging were most consistent
with pulmonary osteoarthropathy. Her pain was treated with oral
dilaudid as needed for pain control.

12. Eye pains: Ms. [**Known lastname 28331**] complained of eye soreness. This was
thought to be secondary to GVHD. She was started on cyclosporin
eye drops and artificial tears. She was evaluated by the
opthalmology consult service who recommended addition of Refresh
eye drops which she continued with relief of her symptoms.
