This is a 51 y/o M w/ hep C who presented with UGIB after 3d of
high dose ibuprofen for new dx of myopericarditis manifested by
coffee ground emesis and aspiration pneumonia.

# GI Bleed: Evidence of gastritis and [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear on
endoscopy with hematocrits stable after 2 U prbcs given in the
ICU. He also had a new finding of colitis on colonoscopy but
this was not likely source for bleed. He has tolerated PO BID
PPI and should continue this until follow up with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
should avoid NSAIDs.
- PPI [**Hospital1 **]
- Monitor Hct daily

# Aspiration pneumonia: The patient presented after vomiting
with fever, elevated WBC count, and CXR/CT findings of
infiltrate, making pneumonia likely [**2-25**] to aspiration of gastric
contents. He was negative for influenza on admission. His
infiltrate persisted over days. He will finish a 14-day course
of levofloxacin/flagyl (for both pneumonia and colitis) on
[**2193-3-31**]. Sputum culture was contaminated but did not show MRSA so
vancomycin discontinued on transfer to medical floor.
Supplemental oxygen was used as necessary to maintain oxygen
saturation > 92%.

# Tachycardia: Tachycardia on admission resolved with volume
repletion, likely resultant from bleeding. He denied recent
alcohol use on admission. He does take benzodiazepines as an
outpatient so this was continued. Tamponade was considered but
echocardiogram showed a trivial pericardial effusion. He
tolerated beta blockade once blood pressure and hematocrit were
found to be stable.

# Myo-pericarditis: Enzymes were trending down on admission.
Echo showed trivial effusion as above. Continued beta blockade.


# Colitis: Unclear etiology but considered etiologies include
ischemic vs. inflammatory. Surgery evaluated the patient after
portal gas was seen on his first CT chest; on repeat CTA the
next day, there was no evidence of portal gas. He was maintained
NPO/sips for bowel rest and then regular diet was restarted
without any adverse effects. He will receive a total 14 day
treatment with levofloxacin 500 mg daily and flagyl 500 mg TID.
This will end on [**2193-3-31**]. The patient was C diff toxin
negative X 2. He will need an outpatient colonoscopy once this
acute episode resolves. Pain was controlled with PO morphine.

# Acetabular rim fracture: The patient was found to have a
fracture on CT scan of the abdomen. Orthopedic consultation was
obtained who recommended two months of touchdown weight bearing
and two months of posterior hip dislocation precautions. He will
follow up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] in
orthopedics. Once hematocrit stabilized he was started on
lovenox 40 mg daily to continue until fully ambulatory.

# Hepatitis: No evidence of varices on endoscopy. Should resume
prior follow up plan.
