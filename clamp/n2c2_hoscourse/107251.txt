66F with CAD s/p CABG [**2085**], HL, PAD s/p B/L AKA in [**2112**] & AAA
endovascular repair [**2104**], hypothyroid, 1 PPD [**Last Name (LF) 1818**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 30-35%
per [**Hospital1 34**] echo [**2114**], obesity, decub ulcer, ventral hernia with
ulceration p/w VT storm to [**Hospital1 34**] now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
possible VT ablation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13177**].
.
#Arrhythmia: SVT with RBBB with intervals of VTach (runs of
between 3 and 18 each time). At least two ectobic sites, one in
the atria causing the SVT and one causing the VT. Probable
causes previous MI, hyper/hypotension, elytes. Pt denies any
CP/SOB/orthopnea. TSH was normal at 1.8. ECG from [**Hospital1 34**] showed
NSVT negative in II, III, F, positive in 1, L, transition at
V3/V4 in setting of SVT possible AT at 260.
ECG on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] in sinus showed RBBB, LAFB, left atrial
abnormality
Pt was started on procainamide gtt at 3, VT initially reduced
but then flared up and gtt was increased to 4, and then DCd
prior to ablation. CCU attending ?????? 60 minutes critical care. Pt
continued to have runs of VT and was taken for ablation. EP lab
transseptal approach to ablate focus in LV, however found
several other foci of VT as well as AT. Given multiple foci not
all of which successfully ablated, decision to treat with
antiarrythmics.  Pt also had a competing atrial tachycardia.
Given procainamide 950mg IV bolus which converted to sinus
(although sinus rhythm difficult to tell from VT - mainly by
rate - VT rate was 130, sinus in 90s) and then transitioned to
amiodarone with procainamide DCd. Pt was monitored but continued
having occasional runs of VT, and plan was to place permanent
pacer. Progressive second degree heart block throughout day
after the procedure with HR transiently dropping to 30s although
BP stable. Resited RIJ to left cordis/ trauma line and placed
temp transvenous pacer. However, she developed septic picture
and permanent hardware was not able to be placed in that setting
(see sepsis, below). Patient had sedation weaned and did not
regain consciousness. In the setting of increasing leukocytosis,
worsening renal failure, anasarca, and acute wound dehiscence at
her groin puncture sites extending deep into the groin tissue,
patient was transitioned to comfort measures only per the wishes
of her family on the morning of [**2116-12-28**]. At 1827 on [**12-28**],
patient expired peacefully of cardiac arrest, with family at
bedside.
.
# Hypotension: Patient's SBP during course of illness ranged
from low of 50s to 90. In the unit the MAPS have been btw 55-70
with SBP of 77-94 and DBP of 48-60. Probable causes are
cardiogenic(previous MI with non-contractile myocardium, SVT/VT,
valvular dxs), hypovolemia, anemia, sepsis, hypothyroidism,
non-compliance to medication). Pt was started on levophed but in
setting of VT/arrythmia with increased ectopy this was changed
to neosynephrine.
.
# CHF: Ptn with previous hx of CAD/MI and CABG.On Ace inh and BB
at home. Probable causes for decompensation include arrythmias,
hypovolemia, anemia. Repeat echo shows decline in EF: [**Month (only) **]/12 -
10-15%, from 30-35% in [**2114**]. Diuresis was attempted with lasix
but was minimally successful. Diuretics then held in setting of
hypotension. ACEI and Bblocker also held in setting of
hypotension.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine 0.8 on [**2116-12-21**], went up to 1.8 on [**2116-12-27**].
Renal assisted in examination of urine sediment and no casts
were seen. Cytology consistent with pre-renal picture (shrunken
RBCs) but no signs of ATN. FeNa was 0.13%.
.
# Sepsis - WBC to 23 on [**2116-12-27**]. Pt still with phenylephrine
pressor requirement, fevers, and intermittently tachycardic. UA
was dirty and there was evidence of skin breakdown around the
areas where pt had vascular access. PT also had history of MRSA
colonization, and was started empirically on vanc/cefepime. -
central line in RIJ was changed over a wire. New line was placed
in LIJ and catheter tip of RIJ was sent for culture. Urine
culture showed no growth. Blood cultures pending at time of
expiration.
.
# Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia. Probably 2/2 blood
loss (dark stool reported), hemolysis or anemia of chronic
illness. Hct down at 31 from 38  five days earlier.
.
# Supratherapeutic INR - pt had INR of 2.5 on presentation (on
warfarin for h/o DVT) which peaked at 4.5 on [**2116-12-26**] even though
coumadin was held after INR was supratherapeutic at 3.5.
.
# Sacral, chest, abdominal, groin wounds: Chronic wounds. Groin
wounds developed secondary to femoral catheterization. Pain
controlled with methadone.
