70 y/o female without significant past medical history who
presented initially with 4 days of cough, malaise, fever at home
dx with pneumonia via xray, admitted to MICU for increased O2
demand and acute kidney injury. Ultimately intubated for
respiratory distress and found to have Pneumococcal sepsis w/
course c/b MODS.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure:
Likely secondary to pneumonia in the setting of underlying COPD,
thus minimal reserve. Patient had progressive increasing work of
breathing ultimately requiring intubation. This was further
complicated by the development of ARDS in the setting of septic
shock, and pulmonary edema from fluid resuscitation. Her
pneumonia was treated with antibiotics (see below) and she
diuresis was started once she was HD stable. Her respiratory
status slowly improved. However, there was concern that due to
critical illness myopathy and resulting poor inspiratory effort,
she would be at high risk of re-intubation. A tracheostomy was
performed on [**6-30**]. Prior to discharge the patient was off the
ventilator with normal saturation on trach mask at FIO2 of 40%.
.
# Pneumosepsis:
Patient presented with leukopenia, bandemia, tachycardia and
tachypnea. Her CXR initially showed RLL infiltrate but evolved
quickly to involve both lungs. She shortly thereafter became
hypotensive and was aggressively fluid repleted and temporarily
required vasopressors. Her blood cultures from OSH prior to
transfer grew Peniccilin sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, as
did her sputum cultures here. She completed a 14 day course of
antitiobics on [**2134-6-27**]. She was afebrile and hemodynamically
stable prior to discharge.
.
# Acute renal failure:
Patient presented with BUN/Cr 115/6.8 in the setting of sepsis,
likely secondary to ATN, with evidence of muddy brown casts on
urine analysis. Renal ultrasound revealed no alternative cause
such as hydronephrosis. Her renal function gradually improved as
she became HD stable. Creatinine on discharge was 1.2.
.
# Thrombocytopenia
Patient had significant fall in platelet count during course of
hospitalization. Patter was concerning for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] heparin was
discontinued, argatroban was started. [**First Name3 (LF) **] antibody was
eventually negative so argatroaban discontinued and resumed
heparin for DVT prophylaxis. Thrombocytopenia ultimately felt to
be medication related. Famotidine was discontinued. Patient's
platelet count gradually normalized.
.
# Altered/Persistent Depressed mental status:
Patient had significant delay in recovery of mental status,
initially attributed to build up of benzodiazepines used for
sedation (on ventilator) in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **], evidenced by
prolonged presence of benzodiazepines in urine. Slowly improved
but some concern for waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] consciousness. MRI revealed
multiple acute subcortical infarctions in both cerebral
hemispheres. EEG was concerning for brief bursts of slowing seen
multifocally, but especially in the right frontal region
suggestive of possible seizure activity. Her EEG prior to
discharge demonstrated no seizure activity. Her clinical status
continued to improve. Outpatient neurology follow-up was
arranged.
.
# Critical Illness Myopathy/Polyneuropathy:
Patient with significant weakness and difficulty gaining motor
function in setting of sepsis and mechanical ventilation with
use of paralytics. Slowly improved throughout her course. Her
clinical status continued to improve. Outpatient neurology
follow-up was arranged.
.
# Fevers:
Patient intially febrile after completion of ATBx course,
however, repeat blood, urine cultures negative and CDiff toxin
negative and no leukocytosis. Gradually resolved and afebrile
for the 72 hours prior to discharge.
.
# Anemia:
HCT steadily trending down, could be from serial phlebotomies
vs. anemia of chronic disease. Stool guaiac negative.
B12/folate/iron studies unremarkable, hemolysis labs negative;
low ferritin and low retic index indicate hypoproliferative
anemia. Likely anemia of acute disease. Remained stable at 24.3
prior to discharge. She should have her hematocrit trended daily
initially. Our transfusion criteria had been hct < 21.

# Dental issues:
Patient noted to have poor dentition. Evaluation by general
dentistry revealed multiple broken molars which need extraction.
-> Panorex as outpatient given that patient is too weak to
stand/sit on stool independently. Will need outpatient f/u with
oral surgery as well.

# s/p Tachycardia
Patient's course was c/b developement of atrial flutter. She was
initially treated with nodal blocking [**Doctor Last Name 360**] with resulting
hypotension. She eventually responded well to amiodarone.
-> Will likely need taper off this medication given unclear need
and potential for more lung toxicity. Will need to discuss this
with her primaryoutpatient providers  upon leaving rehab.

# Transaminitis
LFTs elevated on presentation. Ultimately felt secondary to
hypotension, however in setting of persisten fevers there was
some concern for acalculous cholecystitis. RUQ ultrasound was
initially concerning for tense/enlarged gallbladder, but upon
further review by interventional radiology felt to be within
normal limits and not consistent with alcalculous cholecystitis.
LFTs were downtrending throughout the remainder of her hospital
course.

TRANSITION OF CARE
- Follow-Up Required--Patient will need repeat CT chest to
evaluate potentitial underlying pulmonary mass
--She will need follow up with Primary Care Physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] does
not have an established physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 112069**] will need to follow-up with a dental/oral surgery
--She will need neurology follow up
--Tracheostomy: will need removal of sutures around [**2134-7-10**];
keep tracheostomy neck ties in place at all times per
interventional pulmonary recommendations.
--Will be continued on amiodarone and Lasix upon discharge. Will
need outpatient labwork to evaluate renal function,
electrolytes, normalization of LFTs
