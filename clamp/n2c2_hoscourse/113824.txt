75 yo F presenting with 2 weeks of increasing fatigue, mild
dyspnea, and recent low grade fever and dental abscess.  Given
lab findings, with elevated WBC count to 257K with 98% blasts,
found to have likely acute myelomonocytic leukemia, course of
7+3 chemotherapy complicated by stroke, typhlitis, neutropenic
fever, and likely fungal lung infection.

# Acute leukemia: Healthy 75F with 2-3 weeks of fatigue and
recent possible dental abscess s/p extraction [**6-5**] who presented
with elevated WBC >200K and anemia/thrombocytopenia discovered
at her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**6-13**]. She was admitted to the ICU for emergent
pheresis. In the [**Last Name (LF) 153**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] IJ central line catheter was placed
for pheresis given her WBC of 257 and risk for leukostasis.
After pheresis, her WBC count dropped to 127. She was also
started on hydroxyurea, allopurinol, and emperic cefepime for
chemo. After some discussions with the family she agreed to
chemotherapy and was transfered to BMT service for further
management. She underwent 7+3 cytarabine & idarubicin, course
was complicated by ischemic CVA on [**6-18**] found to have PFO & no
obvious source of thrombus, neutropenic colitis ([**2198-6-23**]),
likely fungal lung infection and neutropenic fever as discussed
below. After coming out of her nadir, patient had leukocytosis
to 20-30k, peripheral smear and flow showed mature monocytes,
possibly consistent with myelodysplasia or robust recovery, less
likely recurrence of leukemia or infection. Bone marrow biopsy
was not done for evidence of remission as patient does not wish
to have further chemotherapy, regardless of potential result.
-Patient will continue to follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] in clinic

#Sepsis/Febrile neutropenia:  Pt had low grade fevers on [**6-30**],
and fever to 101.7 @430 [**7-1**], afebrile at the time of transfer
[**7-2**]. Pt on broad spectrum abx coverage with [**Last Name (un) 2830**]/vanco. CT
chest/abd found new nodule in LLL that was increasing in size
suggesting infectious process. Sinus CT found possible
involvement of the right maxillary sinus.  ENT was consulted and
swab culture of the sinus was unrevealing.  Before being
transferred to the ICU for the second time during this
admission, she also developed hypotension with SBP in 80s after
receving ambisome.  She responded to fluid boluses and did not
require pressor support. At time, the hypotension was consider
to be mult-factorial including side-effect of ambisome as well
as underlying infection.  Cultures were negative. Pt was
continued on broad spectrum abx coverage. A CT chest/abd ([**7-1**])
found enlarging nodule in LLL, and sinus CT found possible
involvement of the right maxillary sinus with oral-antral
fistula. ID consult also followed patient during this admission.
- Per oral maxillofacial surgery there is no evidence of a
current dental abcess or dental infection
- All antibiotics except voriconazole were stopped and patient
was stable for two days prior to discharge.

# Syncope:  Syncopal episode [**2200-6-23**] likely secondary to
vasovagal or orthostatic hypotension.Pt had difficult ambulating
and required more assistance than normal. Now ambulating better
since starting PT.
-PT and OT therapy to continue since pt is still functioning
below baseline. Pt will continue to benefit from acute PT.

# Ischemic CVA - pt w/ new isolated L-sided mouth droop since
[**6-18**], neurology was consulted, MRI showed subtle area of ischemia
in centrum stemi ovale, extending into right insula (vascular
territory of R MCA), echo w/ bubble showed PFO, doppler of
bilateral LEs negative.
-Blood pressure control
-ASA 162mg daily started prior to discharge

#Rash: Patient had new erythematous non-pruritic maculopapular,
blanching rash on the back from the nape of neck to the T8-T9
dermatome. Concern was for leukemia cutis or fungal or drug
rash. Dermatology was consulted and believed the rash was
dependent erythema with early miliaria from recent fevers,
biopsy showed likely drug hypersensitivity reaction. Rash
resolved with removal of meropenem from regimen.

# Typhlitis/Neutropenic colitis: Pt found to have significant
bowel wall thickening and edema from cecum to hepatic flexture
consistent with typhlitis/ neutropenic colitis on [**2200-6-24**]. Pt
did not have abdominal pain but has reported some loose stools.
Broad spectrum coverage with aztreonam and flagyl until [**2200-7-14**],
was stable of antibiotic until discharge, ID followed. C. diff
was negative.

# Pulmonary nodule: [**Month (only) 116**] represent infection vs inflammation.
- Pt on aztrenonam, flagyl, vanco, ambisome
- concern since nodule size has increased in size over 1 week
period
- pt will need follow up CT in 3 months to f/u on nodule
- pt will follow in outpatient [**Hospital **] clinic, to determine length of
voriconazole treatment
