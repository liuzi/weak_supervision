A/P: pt is 44 yo male with hep c cirrhosis, HCC and UGI bleed in
setting of known varices s/p 7 days of nsaid use.
1. GI bleed: Pt was admitted to the MICU for evaluation and
urgent EGD. He was hemodynamically stable throughout admission.
GI bleed thought more likely due to NSAID use than esophageal
varices as varices noted to be mild in past. On admission, he
was started on octreotide transiently. He was transfused 2 units
of PRBC's to keep hct >25 prior to transfer to floor. Endoscopy
revealed: 3 cords of grade 1 varices in lower [**1-14**] of esoph but
no active bleeding. Stomach: melena seen in body but no sign of
active bleeding;antrum with erythema but no bleeding; multiple
acute superficial ulcers 2-5mm in antrum with pigmented material
suggestive of recent bleeding.  He was started on carafate,
protonix, and H pylori serology sentand were negative for
H.Pylori. Emesis resolved s/p EGD and advanced to PO diet which
he tolerated well. Transferred to floor on [**9-17**]. That evening hct
dropped from 31 to 25.1(24.6 on repeat) and he was transfused 1
unit of blood(3rd during admission). He responded appropriately
with hct inc to 27.9. His hct remained stable throughout rest of
admission and had increased to 30.5 by time of discharge. On
discharge, reinforced importance of avoiding NSAIDS to prevent
further GI bleeds.
2. HEME: Thrombocytopenic on admission with platelets of 47. He
has received 1 Units of platelets on admission. On the floor, pt
was transfused another 3 units of platelets to keep plt>75, per
hepatology recommendations. Plt on discharge were 89.
3. [**Name (NI) 52965**] Pt is currently undergoing transplant evaluation.
He was continued on oupt dose of nadalol during admission. He
received one week of ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis in
setting of UGIB. Pt will be in touch with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] for
recommendations of oral surgeons to perform his tooth
extraction. He will need this procedure to be done in hospital
setting where hct and platelets can be monitored. He is also to
f/u in liver center on [**9-21**] as previously scheduled.
4. Smoking cessation - discussed with patient impact of smoking
on health and benefits of cessation. He expressed interest in
quiting and was successful on nicotine patch during admission.
He was discharged on the patch
