He was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery Service as a direct
admission following ERCP. He was given IV hydration and made
NPO. His LFT's and bilirubin were followed closely and slowly
trended downward. Early discussions took place with patient for
operative management with cholecystectomy for which patient
wanted to discuss further with team and his family before
definitively consenting for this.

On [**1-26**] the he underwent a laparoscopic converted to an open
cholecystectomy. POD #1 his urinary output dropped and he
received fluid along with 1 unit pRBC with adequate urinary
response. On POD #2 he was advanced to a regular diet. He
continued to do well. However, overnight he began to drop his O2
sats and became tachycardic. In addition, his Cr rose to 1.6
from 0.9 the day before. A CXR was performed which showed mild
pulmonary vascular congestion. He was given a dose of Lasix with
no response. An ABG revealed hypoxemia with pO2 of 65. Given the
concern for PE and his ongoing hypoxia, he was transferred to
the ICU for close monitoring.

A CTA chest with PE protocol was unable to be performed because
the patient's Cr had bumped to 1.9. Therefore, a CT torso
without contrast was performed which showed a bilateral lower
[**Month/Day (4) 3630**] opacification (L>R) but was otherwise unremarkable. BLE
duplex U/S was negative for DVT. While in the unit, he became
hypotensive with systolic blood pressures ranging between
70s-80s. He was empirically started on vanc/zosyn. The next day
([**2196-2-1**]), his antibiotics were changed to vanc/Cipro/cefepime to
cover hospital acquired pneumonia. An NGT was placed with
immediate return of 500 cc of coffee ground fluid; his HCT was
found to be 22.8. He was transfused 2 units of pRBC's. GI team
was consulted regarding a potential upper endoscopy. However,
they felt EGD would require elective intubation and therefore
the procedure was deferred. The patient was aggressively fluid
resuscitated and his urine output remained adequate. The
following day his Cr dropped to 1.3 and he was sent for a CTA
with PE protocol which was indeterminate for PE due to motion
artifact but did not show thrombus in the aortoiliac or pelvic
veins. Serial HCT were trended and remained stable. An echo was
attempted [**2-1**] but the quality was suboptimal secondary to the
patient's large body habitus. He still had a significant
supplemental oxygen requirement.

Over the next few days in the ICU his respiratory status
remained tenuous. He was started on intermittent Lasix boluses
[**2196-2-1**] which resulted in large diuresis and he was able to be
weaned to nasal cannula. On [**2196-2-2**], he was started on 20mg PO
Lasix daily and was given 40mg IV Lasix as well as a dose of
Diamox. He again responded with a brisk diuresis but then became
hypotensive overnight requiring 2.5L of fluid boluses. His HCT
in the AM was 21 and he was transfused one unit pRBC's. The
patient also developed an urticarial rash on [**2196-2-2**] and this was
attributed to having switched his Cipro from IV to PO. The Cipro
was therefore discontinued and he was started on Levofloxacin.
His rash has virtually resolved at time of this dictation.

He remained on the Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for the pneumonia
for a total of 7 day course, stop date [**2196-2-10**]. He is also
receiving Flagyl for a presumed C. difficile colitis given his
stool volume. It should be noted that he has had 2 negative
stool for C. Diff cultures. His treatment with Flagyl will
continue for a total of 7 day course. A Flexi seal system was
placed rectally for stool containment and protection of
patient's skin given his large body habitus. Cholestyramine was
started as well.

He was also seen by Psychiatry for his anxiety and depression
and it was recommended to increase his Celexa to 40 mg daily
from 30 mg and to avoid benzodiazepines as this would put him at
risk for delirium.

He was evaluated by Physical therapy and is being recommended
for rehab after his acute hospital stay.
