45 yo female with ESLD [**1-15**] EtOH cirrhosis s/p TIPS who presented
from OSH for liver transplant evaluation, recent severe
bleeding, who developed sepsis, DIC, and multiorgan failure. A
brief hospital course by problem is outlined below:
.
#Sepsis/DIC: The patient required multiple vasopressors to
maintain SvO2 >70 and MAP>60s. Lactate continued to rise and she
became progressively acidotic. End organ hypoperfusion was
demonstrated by anuria. She was treated broadly with antibiotics
and aggressively transfused with blood products and albumin for
intravascular volume support and to correct her underlying
coagulopathy. HCO3 was utilized prn given worsening acidosis.
The patient was made CMO after an extensive family discussion
regarding her poor prognosis and she rapidly expired after
removal of vasopressors and respiratory support.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Progressively worsening bilateral lung
infiltrates resulting in hypoxia requiring intubation.
Differential included DAH given coagulopathy, infection (e.g.
PCP/fungal given recent course of steroids), or TRALI (though
unlikely). She was afebrile with rapidly progressive
leukocytosis. The patient was treated with steroids and bactrim
for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 74369**] for fungal coverage, and levaquin to cover
mycoplasma, and flagyl for anaerobic coverage. Given worsening
infiltrates and P/F ratio suggestive of ARDS, she was ventilated
on ARDSnet protocol to minimize barotrauma and allowed
permissive hypercapnea.
.
# Acute renal failure: Cr progressively worsened in the setting
of sepsis and the patient became anuric. Differential included
HRS, ATN [**1-15**] renal hypoperfusion, prerenal [**1-15**] hypoalbuminemia
and 3rd spacing. She was unable to take po octreotide, midodrine
due to increased GI secretions and poor absorption. Attempted to
increased intravascular volume with albumin and blood products.
Pressors were utilized to maintain renal perfusion. The patient
developed a severe lactic acid metabolic acidosis due to tissue
hypoxia requiring HCO3 pushes.
.
# ETOH Cirrhosis: Decompensated liver disease s/p TIPS, with
hepatic encephalopathy, coagluapathy, elevated Tbili,
hyponatremia. On admission, aldactone held given hyponatremia
and hypotension. Lasix held given auto-immune hemolytic anemia.
She was given lactulose and rifaxamin for hepatic
encephalopathy. Ultrasound perfomed on admission and showed
patent TIPS, cirrhotic liver, no hepatoma. Diagnostic
paracentesis was performed, and was negative for SBP.
.
During hospitalization, she was evaluated for liver transplant,
and was transiently placed on the transplant list but was
removed after becoming septic. TTE showed a hyperdynamic EF,
with no pulmonary hypertension or significant valvular disease.
Liver CT completed. PFT's performed, with noted mild diffusion
abnormality. Chest CT demonstrated pulmonary nodules (see below)
which were stable on repeat CT chest one week later.  Chest CT
from [**2106-6-16**] showed marked worsening (see below).
.
Hospitalization was complicated by hepatic encephalopathy,
hyponatremia and hepatorenal syndrome.  HRS improved after
midodrine and octreotide, and albumin steadied hyponatremia near
baseline of 127-129.  She was fluid restricted, but continued to
have worsening peripheral edema; diuretics were held given her
recently diagnosed AIHA [**1-15**] lasix.
.
# Arrhythmia: The patient had two asymptomatic episodes of
stable Vtach on the floor. On [**2106-6-16**], pt developed atrial
fibrillation to 160's.  She was converted with lopressor and
diltiazam, but then reverted to Afib/flutter rate-controlled on
diltiazem.  On transfer to the MICU, she had bursts of atrial
flutter with variable block and rate-dependent bundle branch
block.  She remained asymptomatic but nodal agents were held
given hypotension.
.
# Leukocytosis: Initially with nosocomial pneumonia at outside
hospital treated with a course of IV antibiotics. Upon admission
to [**Hospital1 18**], no infectious etiology was found, with negative blood,
urine and stool cultures. Although pulmonary nodules were seen
on chest CT, this was not felt to represent an acute infectious
process given lack of associated signs or symptoms of infection,
therefore no further antibiotics were given.  Acute alcoholic
hepatitis was considered as a possible cause of leukocytosis,
however there was no recent alcohol use to go along with this
diagnosis.
.
On [**6-5**], UCx with VRE.  On [**6-11**], pt's blood cultures positive
for VRE.  Felt that PICC line was possible source; however,
wound tip culture showed no growth.  She was started on
daptomycin and ceftriaxone per ID.  Echocardiogram was negative
for vegetation.  On [**6-16**], a repeat chest CT was performed for
further characterization of pulmonary nodules which revealed the
interval development of diffuse hazy opacities thought to be
consistent with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 7470**] given that she was weaned off
steroids for AIHA only days earlier. She was started emperically
on treatment doses of bactrim however she continued to worsen.
Diagnostic bronchoscopy was considered upon transfer to the ICU
however the patient was too unstable for the procedure. Flagyl
also emperically started for C. diff.
.
# Coagulopathy: [**1-15**] liver disease. Pt has had multiple red blood
cell transfusions, FFP, cryo, and platelets during admission.
Also received ddAVP for uremic platelets.  She had an episode of
profuse epistaxis in the setting of trauma from Doboff feeding
tube that could only be controlled with packing, Afrin and
pressure by ENT.  She also bled from her paracentesis site,
requiring transfusion and sutures. She developed DIC and diffuse
mucosal bleeding after becoming septic.
.
# Auto-Immune Hemolytic Anemia: Diagnosed with auto-immune
hemolytic anemia at outside hospital, felt to be secondary to
lasix. Re-consulted hematology here who agreed with this
diagnosis. Lasix was held during admission and repeat coombs
antibody negative. Reticulocyte count high on admission (29%),
with elevated LDH, tbili, and decreasing hematocrit suggestive
of ongoing hemolysis. However, hemolysis indices improved on
prednisone, and slow prednisone taper initiated as indices
stabilized. Blood counts supported as needed with blood
transfusions (for hgb <7 given difficult crossmatch (she has two
antibodies).
.
# GI: EGD performed on this admission demonstrated grade 1
esophageal varices, a trans-endoscopic NJ feeding tube, and
otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum.
