Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year-old male admitted following successful
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy, Buttressing of intrathoracic
anastomosis with thymic fat pad Laparoscopic jejunostomy,
Therapeutic bronchoscopy, Esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  He was
transferred to the SICU intubated and sedated, NGT, right chest
tube, JP drain and Epidural for pain. He was extubated on POD1,
placed on 3L NC and humidified face tent with oxygen saturations
> 90%.  His oxygen requirement increased requiring aggressive
pulmonary toilet, nebs, and chest PT.  Initially he was
hypovolemic, fluid challenge was given with a good response.
Once his respiratory status improved he transferred to the floor
on [**2125-10-15**]. On POD 6 ([**10-16**]) barium swallow negative for leak
and diet advanced to clears which were well tolerated. On POD 8
([**10-18**]), pt experienced acute R sided CP and RUQ abd pain,
hypoxia, and diaphoresis. CXR demonstrated ptx. DART placed with
bilious drainage, EGD showed necrosis at anastomotic site. Pt
returned to OR for debridement gastric conduit and repair POD 9
([**10-19**]) and admitted to TSICU postoperatively with CTx3, JPx2. Pt
underwent EGD POD 14 ([**10-24**]) with healthy-appearing anastomosis.
On POD 19 ([**10-29**]) pt undersent percutaneous tracheostomy
placement. Pt noted to have persistent JP drainage. On POD 30
([**11-9**]), pt underwent esophageal stenting and NGT was
discontinued. JP output transiently decreased but subsequently
increased after stent placement. On POD 46 ([**11-25**]) pt underwent
EGD which demonstrated good stent position and endoscopically
placed NGT.  He continued to have respiratory distress requiring
mechanical ventilation, with tachypnea and agitation with any
withdrawal of sedation.  His hospital course remained stable
until [**2125-12-18**], requiring sedation and mechanical ventilation.
On [**2125-12-19**], the family requested no further interventions, and
that he be allowed to pass if he began to worsen.  On [**2125-12-21**],
with the family at bedside, his ventilation was turned off, and
he expired at 11:30am.
