Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2107-8-23**]. A repeat LP on admission showed normal cells, glucose
and protein. A CSF sample was also obtained for viral cultures
and different viral and fungal Ab titers (including West Nile
Virus, Arboviruses, HSV, HBVs). Routine cultures for bacterial,
TB and other infectious agents were also normal. Cytology was
normal.

Despite the therapeutic levels of PTN and the IV infusion of
Ativan, electroencephalogram (EEG) on admission showed
epileptiform sharp spike activity suggestive of ongoing
epileptict activity. Therefore, a Penotarbital infusion was
started. The Pentobarbital infusion was titrated to obtain a
burst- suppression pattern on bedside 24 h, EEG monitoring. In
particular, the EEG showed sharp waves complexes every 6 to 10
seconds. Dilantin and Depakote were continued as well. At this
point, pressors were started to compensate to the Pentobarbital-
induced decreased cardiac function.

Mr [**Known lastname **] condition did not improve and another magnetic resonance
imaging examination ([**8-24**]) showed multicentric areas of T2
hyperintensity with more concentration in the right frontal as
well as bilateral thalami. Laboratory studies throughout Mr.
[**Known lastname **] admission included several blood cultures, urine cultures
and extensive toxic metabolic workup. Another LP for
cerebrospinal fluid analysis for infection, toxic metabolic and
cytological analysis was also performed.

In order to better elucidate the underlying pathology. A brain
and meningeal biopsy was performed on [**8-24**] in the right
frontal lobe.

In regards to empiric treatment, after the brain biopsy, the
patient received IV Solu- Medrol and high doses of antibiotics
with broad coverage.  The Infectious Disease team was also
involved in the care of Mr. [**Known lastname **]. All the tests performed on his
tissues and fuids obtained under request of the ID team, had
thus far come back normal.

Brain and meningeal biopsy were remarkable for an meningitic
eosinophilic infiltrates and extensive ischemic cortical neuronal
damage (red neurons). There was no evidence of an infectious
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] on traditional staining and/or on electronic microscopy.

Several attempts in decreasing the dose of Pentobarbital resulted
in an increased epileptiform activity on bedside EEG monitor.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] condition deteriorated even further. He had developed
ileus, and his abdomen was hyperextended.  He had been intubated
throughout his entire stay in the Intensive Care Unit and was
increasingly dependent on ventilatory support.

At this point, the patient's  poor clincal status and prognosis
was thoroughly discussed with his closest family members. After
a family meeting, it was decided that Mr. [**Known lastname **] would no longer
benefit from aggressive support.  Therefore, he was extubated
and expired briefly thereafter.
