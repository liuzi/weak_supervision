Patient was a 53 year-old male with a history of relapsing
refractory ALL on prednisone and rituximab and HCV cirrhosis who
presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension.
Patient was hypotensive, started on pressors, given IVF,
worsened in the setting of adrenal insuffiency, and synthetic
hepatic dysfunction. Patient was intubated. Once infectious
etiology was eliminated, patient's dim prognosis was discussed
with family and a determination was made to make the patient
CMO. Patient was extubated and started on morphine drip.
Patient, due to high drug tolerance, continued to have pain and
was responsive on morphine drip. Patient was transferred from
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to BMT floor for CMO continuation. Patient continued to
show signs of discomfort and sedatation was switched to dilaudid
and ativan drip. Patient expired at 7:20 pm on [**2116-12-10**]
secondary to respiratory failure from relapsing refractory ALL
in the presence of the family. The proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 2479**], the
patient's son, consented to a full autopsy.
