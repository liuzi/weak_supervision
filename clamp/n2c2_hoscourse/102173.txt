1. Hematuria: evaluated and followed by urology who felt this
cause of this was tPA used to clear his PICC line on a
background of radiation cysitis.  CTU was without acute change.
Hematocrit initially stable, but on HD2 required 1 u prbc
transfusion.  He was started on CBI and attained clear urine on

suprapubic discomfort at admission and had received a dose of
antibiotics prior to admission.  This was discontinued in the
ICU and his urine culture demonstrated no growth.  Urology
recommended the use of either detrol or ditropan as necessary to
control bladder spasms.
**** Note: DO NOT USE ANY HEPARIN BASED PRODUCTS OR TPA IN THIS
PATIENT. This can cause gross hematuria in his Foley.  His
bladder is only 20 cc capacity. If PICC clotted, would consider
resiting it.
