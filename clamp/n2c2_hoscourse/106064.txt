50 y/o M with h/o IV drug abuse, cirrhosis, ETOH, hep C, and DM
who presents with L4/L5 osteomyelitis. S/p CT-guided bx of L4/L5
disc on [**8-11**]-Yeast grown from disc cx found to be [**Female First Name (un) **]
albicans. Complicated by thrombocytopenia, ARF, and hypotension.

.
1. L4-L5 osteomyelitis w/ phlegmonous extension: An initial
evaluation by neurosurgery was performed. However, neurosurgery
did not feel that the pt was a candidate for surgery. A medical
approach was taken with various antibiotics over the course of
the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay. An initial blood cx at [**Hospital3 **]
grew [**2-9**] coag-neg staph. No further blood or urine cultures were
positive. So it was thought to be a contaminant although this
could not be ruled out. For this reason, the pt was stared on
Vancomycin which was discontinued later during the hospital
course b/o suspected bone marrow suppression thought to cause
significant thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and anemia. A disc cx
from [**8-11**] grew sparse [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans and beta-glucan lab test
was positive making [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans osteomyelitis most likely
despite a bone cx from [**8-12**] showing no growth. The pt was started
on Amphotericin after the positive cx results. At that time he
was still treated with both Vancomycin and Amphotericin.
However, the pt developed ATN which was attributed to
Amphotericin. So both Vancomycin and Amphotericin have been
D/C'd over the course of his stay b/o ATN and
thrombocytopenia/leukopenia, and treatment with Caspofungin has
been started on [**8-17**] (initially with 35 mg IV q24h, later
increased to 50 mg IV q24h) and continued throughout the
remainder of his stay. The patient was moved to the ICU when
developing recurrent hypotension and worsening renal failure,
but recovered soon thereafter. The patient improved
significantly towards the end of his hospital stay and his
symptoms were well controlled at discharge. He was afebrile and
able to ambulate. A lumbar brace has been placed. CRP was
trending down from 58.6 [**2101-8-7**] to 11.8 [**2101-9-13**]. Further recovery
is expected at an extended care facility. Followup appointments
have been scheduled with ID and neurosurgery. An outpatient MRI
of the L-spine has been scheduled as well. The patient should
also get weekly CBC, LFTs and BUN/Crea while on Caspofungin.
Results should be faxed to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9404**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**].
.
2. Acute Renal Failure. Baseline creatinine was 0.7-0.9 (0.9 on
[**8-15**]). Crea was 2.4 on [**8-16**].8 on [**8-17**].0 on [**8-19**]. He was
anuric from [**Date range (1) 67404**] with uremic symptoms (nausea/vomiting).
His Crea was 5.7 on [**8-22**] after starting CVV hemodialysis on
[**8-20**]. After having been in the ICU b/o ARF and recurrent
hypotension, the patient recovered quickly on the floor and his
kidneys proceded to the polyuric phase. Crea 1.6 on [**8-28**]. Crea
came down to 1.3 towards the end of his stay. After the polyuric
phase, the kidney function returned to [**Location 213**] output. The
patient was asymptomatic at discharge.
.
3. Thrombocytopenia. Plts 152 on admission, Plts 69 on [**8-13**]
on [**8-20**].  Anti-platelet4 (HIT) antibody was positive and the
patient was initially thought to have HIT. All heparin products
were D/C'ed. However, on [**8-26**] Serotonin Release Ab came back
negative. Since HIT Ab not very specific and SRA test negative,
the diagnosis of HIT was questioned at this point. Treatment
with Vancomycin correlated with the worsening thrombocytopenia
and was thought to be a likely cause. After having D/C'ed
Vancomycin, the CBC improved consistently. The pt did not bleed
significantly except for mild R conjunctival bleeding observed
[**8-22**]. Platelet transfusions were given on [**8-24**] in order to raise
plts temporarily for line removals. Platelets came up from 20 to
31 o/n. Platelets came up considerably towards the end of his
stay (Platelets 77 on [**8-31**]). The patient was discharged without
any signs of active bleeding and hemodynamically stable.
.
4. Anemia: Hct 35.9 on [**8-7**].5 on [**8-24**], Pt received 2U PRBC on
[**8-25**] raising Hct up to 26.3 and stable thereafter. Following
course of renal dysfunction, perhaps due to low erythropoeitin
levels. Iron studies consistent w/ ACD. Also occult bleeding was
considered since pt was also thrombocytopenic, cirrhotic, and
uremic. Stools were guaiaced. Improvement was noted when
Vancomycin was D/C'ed. Vancomycin was likely cause of
suppression of all three lines in the bone marrow although
multiple factors were certainly involved. Patient's Hct came up
again towards the end of his stay. Hct was 29.6 [**2101-9-13**]. Pt was
asymptomatic at discharge.
.
5. Leukopenia: WBC dropped down to 2.9 on [**8-24**], but after that
continuously rising. WBC 4.0 on [**8-28**] and stable thereafter
(previous baseline [**6-13**]). Possible causes were immunosuppression
b/o fungal osteo or medications, especially Vancomycin which
causes bone marrow suppression. Vanco had been D/C'ed. WBC
stable. Patient did not develop any opportunistic infections and
his osteomyelitis stayed stable despite the transient
leukopenia. Pt was asymptomatic at discharge.
.
6. Pain: Low back pain with radiation to both legs (R>L) was
managed throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay with a variety of
pain medications including a Fentanyl patch, Methadone at
increasing doses, Morphine, Dilaudid IV and PO, Oxycontin and
Oxycodone. The patient became hypotensive on some of these
medications. The fentanyl patch was D/C'ed b/o that although
multiple factors were likely responsible for his hypotensive
episodes. Methadone was tapered during his hospitalization by 20
mg/day with MSContin increased by 30 mg/day throughout the
taper. His pain regimen on discharge is as follows: MSContin 430
mg [**Hospital1 **], Neurontin 900 mg tid, Tylenol 500 mg qid, Dilaudid 30 mg
q4-6h prn, Tramadol 50 mg q4-6h prn.
.
7. Thigh pain: New left lateral thigh pain on [**8-25**] and right
lateral thigh pain on [**8-28**]. No bruise or bulge at either thigh.
DVT on L leg ruled out with LENIS. Pain seems to be muscular and
most likely due to recent use of LE muscles after extended
periods of immobility. The pain was managed with the same
medications as stated above. The new quality of pain subsided
soon after having been mobile for longer periods and was thought
to be different from his radiating back pain [**3-10**] osteomyelitis.
.
8. Acute scrotal pain: Pt developed acute left scrotal pain
radiating up his groin and flank on [**8-17**]. Pt received 500 cc IV
NS bolus, 4 mg Dilaudid, scrotal and renal u/s were unremarkable
except for an incidentally found R testicular lesion. Urology
was consulted. DD included testicular torsion, orchitis, acute
kidney stone, inguinal hernia. Doppler U/S of kidneys negative
for [**Month/Year (2) 5703**] thrombosis on [**8-17**]. The pain subsided soon after having
been treated with Dilaudid. The exact cause of this episode
remains unclear. A followup appointment has been scheduled with
urology in order to work up the R testicular cystic lesion as
outpt.
.
9. DM: Pt was formerly on Glyburide. Last HbA1c normal. Pt was
rather hypoglycemic at beginning of his hospital stay and was
treated as needed. For the majority of his stay, FS were stable.
Pt was started on metformin 500 mg qam one week prior to
discharge. Pt was asymptomatic throughout his stay.
.
10. Cirrhosis/Hep C: no history of GI bleeding, encephalopathy
or any other complications in the past. Pt developed transiently
cholestatic labs during stay, likely due to infectious process
and mulitple medications. Pt was briefly icteric, but returned
quickly to normal state. Labs remained at baseline elevation for
the remainder of his stay. Pt received Hepatitis A vaccination.
The outpatient medication Spironolactone has been discontinued
during the hospital stay because the patient developed acute
renal failure. It was not restarted upon discharge. It is
recommended to discuss the restarting of spironolactone with his
liver team during follow up as an outpatient.
.
11. Hyponatremia: Initially progressed to sodium of 124, but
later wnl. Pt was euvolemic throughout his hospital stay. No rx
was necessary and sodium was stable at discharge.
.
12. Pos UCx: The patient had GNR growing from a UCx on [**8-30**]
after having spiked a fever once the day before. The UA was
repeatedly negative and the patient remained afebrile
thereafter. A CXR was also negative and a repeat MRI of the
L-spine did not show any significant change to previous MRIs.
The patient completed a seven-day course of ciprofloxacin and
remained asymptomatic.
.
13. HTN: Pt was normotensive with an episode of hypotension as
described above. BP medications were held and BP was monitored
throughout his stay. It is recommended that his medications are
started as an outpatient after monitoring his BP for hypotension
and reevaluating his hypertension.
.
14. H/o alcohol abuse:  Pt was monitored on CIWA, with prn
Ativan.
.
15. FEN: cardiac/diabetic diet.
.
16. Prophylaxis: Initially SC heparin, pneumoboots when off
heparin. Ambulatory towards the end of his stay. Bowel regimen,
PPI.
.
17. Access: PICC placed on [**8-15**] and kept on discharge for
outpatient treatment. IJ and HD catheter were removed [**8-24**] after
2x platelet transfusions plus 1x FFP b/o low ptls and
chronically high INR [**3-10**] cirrhosis.
.
