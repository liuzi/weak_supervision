Transferred in from OSH and underwent cardiac catherization that
resulted in intra aortic balloon pump placement and transferred
to operating room emergently [**9-19**].  Please see catherization
report for further details.  He underwent coronary artery bypass
graft x5, please see operative report for further details.  He
was transferred to the CSRU on Neo and propofol with IABP.  He
received FFP, protamine, and platlets for post operative
bleeding, and then returned to operating room for reexploration,
please see operative report for further details.  He was
transferred to CSRU for continued management.  He continued with
tachycardia not responsive to esmolol was changed to cardizem
with better control, required vasopressors for hypotension.  On
postoperative day [**1-16**] the IABP was weaned and removed, he
continued on vasopressors, cardizem was discontinued and he was
started on beta blockers.  He remained intubated due to
hemodynamics and agitation.  Agitation continued with weaning of
sedation, diuresed, and betablocker increased.  Postoperative
day [**4-18**] tolerated CPAP and was extubated but was confused moving
all extremeties. Blood pressure and heart rate labile, labetolol
started.  Postoperative [**6-20**] he went into atrial fibrillation and
treated with Amiodarone and beta blockers. He remained in the
CSRU due to agitation on CIWA d/t ETOH withdrawal, hemodynamic,
and respiratory management.  Psychiatry consulted due to
continued delirium and medications adjusted.  Anticoagulation
was started for atrial fibrillation with coumadin on POD [**11-25**].
On postoperative 14/13 he was ready for transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 2 with
a sitter, he continued with confusion at times, in/out atrial
fibrillation.  He continued to progress and physical activity
increased, he became more oriented, and was able to wean off
ativan and sitter.  On posterative day 20/19 he complained of
not being able to see out of left eye - opthamology evaluated
with question of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy which is
diagnosis by exclusion and he underwent MRI.  Plan for follow up
with opthamology in clinic no medical intervention at this time.
 On postoperative day 21/20 creatinine elevated with decreased
sodium. Fluid intake was increased, renal consulted,
echocardiogram (EF 35-40%).  All diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and
NSAID discontinued.  Creatinine decreased on Postoperative day
23/22 but sodium remained decreased and placed on free water
restriction with plan for chemistry to be rechecked [**10-14**] at
rehab.  He was ready for discharge to rehab with plan for lab
checks.
