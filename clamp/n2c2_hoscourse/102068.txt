43 yo femaled with advanced ovarian cancer, was admitted with
complaints of fever, chills, and was found to have SIRS/septic
shock, and was initially managed in the ICU.  She was started on
empiric coverage with broad spectrum antibiotics.  She was found
to be bacteremic with strep anginosus, which is likely d/t
intrabdominal fisulization/abscesses. A CT of her abdomen and
pelvis (without contrast due to allergy) showed significantly
worsening ovarian cancer, colovaginal fistulization, and
possible microperforation vs infection at her [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch.
She clinically stabilized, however further discussion with her
oncologist and surgeon revealed that there are no further
therapeutic options to offer, and she is not a candidate for
surgery. Her primary oncologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She
was transitioned to DNR/DNI, and she elected to go home with
hospice care.

Her blood cultures later revealed strep anginosus (milleri), and
her antibiotics were changed to oral flagyl and levofloxacin, as
she prefered an oral regimen for palliation.  At the time of
discharge, she was still having low-grade temps, but seh was not
symptomatic from them.  She will complete a 2 week course of
antibiotics on [**2193-6-5**].
.
* Colovaginal fistula - She has a known colovaginal fistula,
however there are no surgical options per GynOnc discussion.  It
does appear that her vaginal discharge may be improving slightly
with antibiotic treatment.
.
* LLE Edema - She was noted to have some left sided edema
(LLE/LUE). THere was intially concern for possible DVT, however
LENI;s were negative.  The edema is most likely related to =
tumor blocking lymphatic drainage. Elevation and LLE compression
hose were recommended for comfort.
.

chemotherapy options. Transitioned to DNR/DNI and palliative
care consulted and assisted throughout the hospitalization.

* DM -
Pt had several episodes of hypoglycemia on lantus due to
decreasing oral intake. Her lantus dose was serially
downtitrated. Tight glucose control not necessary at this time,
but would like to avoid extreme highs that may produce symptoms.

- Pt discharged on reduced lantus dose without sliding scale.
.
* Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
.
* Hyperlipdemia - Hold statin and Tricor
.
* Ostomy Retraction - Ostomy is retracted as per ostomy nurse
and surgery consult. Now with resuming stool output. KUB showed
some stool c/w constipation. She was treated with Miralax with
some improvement in her stool output.  She was recommened to
continue to take stool softeners and  Miralax and to stay well
hydrated to prevent constipation in the future.  She may also
use milk of magnesia as well as needed.
.
PPX: Pt is at high risk for DVT given ovarian cancer. Pt will be
discharged on daily dosing of lovenox to prevent DVT for
palliative benefit
