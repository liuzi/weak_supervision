Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year-old female with multiple medical
problems including HBV, fatty liver, colonic mass s/p resection,
HTN, hyperlipidemia, who was initally admitted on [**10-23**]
for increasing dyspnea over the six weeks prior to admission and
increased pleuritic chest pain on the right side.
*
1) DYSPNEA: After admission, a CXR was done which showed a right
sided pleural effusion.  CTA was also done to rule out a
pulmonary embolus.  This did not show a PE; however, showed
several mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest precarinal,
measuring 1.4 cm.  There was also right-sided pleural nodular
densities and several small nodules bilaterally, the largest
located in the RLL anterior to the pleural effusion, measuring
~8mm.  Right lung base atelectasis was present, with a
moderate-sized pleural effusion.  No PE was seen, however.  The
differential at that time was thought to be
inflammatory/infectious, less likely vasculitis or neoplastic. A
follow-up CT was recommended.  On [**2197-10-25**], thoracentesis of the
right pleural effusion was performed by the interventional
pulmonology fellow and the pleural fluid obtained was consistent
with an exudative fluid with an elevated red count (trauma) and
lymphocytsosis.  Cultures of the fluid were negative, and
cytology was negative for malignant cells.  The patient then
developed fevers to 101.7 with new wheezing and was thought to
have a pneumonia with a component of reactive airway
disease/COPD.  On [**10-28**], she was started on
vancomycin/flagyl/levofloxacin (these were later discontinued on
[**11-11**]).  She was also started on solumedrol and MDI's.  On
[**10-30**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] then developed hypercarbic respiratory failure
and was found to have stridor/wheezing on exam which did not
improve with racemic epi.  At this point, she was transferred to
the MICU. In the MICU, the patient was stabilized on BIPAP and
nebulizers.  She was transferred back to the floor on [**11-5**].
After a few days on the floor, the patient again developed
increasing dyspnea.  A CXR was performed which showed an
increase in the size of her right sided effusion.  On [**11-9**],
another thoracentesis was attempted to take fluid off and make
the patient more comfortable; however, fluid could not be
aspirated.  The patient's lung was imaged by the interventional
pulmonology (IP) fellow with US and thick fluid vs. consildation
vs. lung parenchyma was obseved. The IP fellow suggested that a
CT scan be performed for better characterization of the effusion
seen on CXR, as well as VATS to obtain tissue at the pleural
nodule for a diagnosis.  The patient could not lie supine due to
significant respiratory distress, so she was transferred back to
the MICU for elective intubtaion to obtain CT scan and
subsequent VATS.  The repeat chest CT on [**11-10**] showed an
increased right sided collection with worsening atelactasis of
right middle lobe and right lower lobe. There was also increased
nodular thickening of right upper lobe.  On [**2197-11-10**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**]
(thoracic surgery) performed a VATS and pleural biopsy.  Two
chest tubes were placed during the surgery for drainage of her
effusion.  The effusion was loculated, so thoracic surgery used
TPA to break up fibrinous locuations.   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] did well
post-op with only minor pain at the incision site.  This was
controlled with morphine.  On [**11-12**], the patient was trasferred
back to the floor.  She was maintained on nebulizers for
respiratory comfort and morphine for pain control.  On [**11-15**], the
pathology from her pleural biopsy obtained during VATS revealed
a metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  Immunostains were
positive for CEA, cytokeratin, and S100, but negative for
MART-1, TTF-1, B72.3, and calretinin.  The patient was notified
of the results and she reported that she did not want any
chemotherapy.  After agreement by the patient, medical oncology
was consulted to review her case and present the possible
options to her before she made this decision final.  After
seeing oncology, the patient still held to not wanted
chemotherapy.  She said that she wanted to go home to [**State 3914**]
with her son, who is a retired nurse.  Her son decided that he
would care for her in his home.  He arranged to have hospital
bed sent to his home, and arranged to have physician who will
visit Mrs. [**Known lastname **] at home.  An ambulance was arranged to
transport the patient from [**Location (un) 86**] to [**State 3914**].
*
2. PNEUMONIA: The patient had a CXR done on [**10-27**] which showed a
nodular density right mid zone.  Given her fragile respiratory
status, this was treated as pneumonia with
levo/flagyl/vancomycin.  The antibiotic course was continued
from [**10-28**] until [**11-11**].
*
3. NON-ST ELEVATION MI: During her admission, the patient had
episodes of chest pain.  At one point, her cardiac enzymes
trended up to a high of trop = 0.32.  EKG was without changes.
These cardiac enzymes subsequently trended down.  Other episodes
of chest pain on this admission were not accompanied by EKG
changes or elevation of cardiac enzymes.
*
4.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: During her admission, the patient had
ARF with a high creatinine of 3.6.  The was likely of prerenal
etiology given her urine lytes at the time.  With IV hydration,
her creatinine trended down, and on discharge was 0.5
*
5.  ANEMIA: The patient had a low Hct throughout her admission
(low 30's to high 20's).  Her stools were guaiac negative. She
was transfused to maintain Hct<30.
*
8.  ABDOMINAL PAIN: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] periodically complained RUQ and
epigastric abdominal pain throughout her admission.  Two RUQ
ultrasounds were obtained which were normal without evidence of
cholelithiasis or cholecystits.  Her LFTs and amylase/lipase
also remained within normal limits.  Her abdominal pain was
thought to be due to peptic ulcer disease.  She was maintained
on her PPI.
*
9.  DIARRHEA: She also complained of diarrhea towards the end of
her hospital course.  She was tested for C. diff, which was
negative x 3.  Her diarrhea was likely a side effect of her
antibiotics.
*
10. HTN: The patient was maintained on her outpatient regimen
for HTN.
*
11. PROPHYLAXIS:  She was maintained on pneumoboots, SC heparin,
bowel regimen, and PPI.
*
12. CODE STATUS: Throughout her hospital admission, the patient
was full code.  After she was given the diagnosis of NSCC, this
issue was re-addressed.  After a discussion with the patient and
her son, she made the decision to change her status to DNR/DNI
and maintained that status on discharge from the hospital.
