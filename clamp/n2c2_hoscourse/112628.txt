52yo man with longstanding HTN and [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with intracranial hemorrhage, suspected secondary to
hypertensive crisis.  The size of his bleed, the need for
frequent neuro checks, and his need for antihypertensives via
continuous drip necessitate ICU admission.  His Left-sided
sensory symptoms were well-explained by his Right-thalamic
bleed, and there were no symptoms that were unexplained by this
lesion. Although we do not have records of his blood pressure at
the time of EMS contact, the presumptive etiology of this
hemorrhagic infarct is uncontrolled hypertension. Renal consult
was called re. the acute-on-chronic renal failure, and
recommended discontinuing his NSAIDs (taken for ?gout), which
was done, and measuring urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, which
revealed gross proteinuria >5,000.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the floor after several days in the
ICU. Continued issues were blood glucose control (managed with
insulin sliding-scale) and acute renal failure (initially ~2.0
and steady, but then up to 2.7 in the setting of UTI and Cipro
Tx, all above a reported baseline CKD/Cr 1.5), despite IVF and
holding the patient's previous indomethacin. On the floor, he
became more confused and febrile, and was found to have a
gram-negative UTI. Initially, he was treated empirically with
ciprofloxacin, but this worsened his renal failure, and the
patient became febrile and somnolent/lethargic, so he was
switched to IV vancomycin and Zosyn (vancomycin was discontinued
[**12-7**] after UCx from [**12-5**] showed gram-positive bacteria). This
UCx ultimately speciated a pan-sensitive [**Last Name (LF) 88119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] on [**12-8**]
(day of discharge) after 3.5d of treatment with IV Zosyn, he was
switched to PO Bactrim, plan to finish a 7-8d course for
complicated (male) UTI. Fever defervesced rapidly and mental
status improved markedly 1-2d after starting IV antibiotics, and
creatinine began improving after it peaked at 2.7 the day before
discharge (down to 2.5 on [**12-8**]). Blood cultures and a repeat
UCx on [**12-5**] (after first dose of Cipro) have remained no growth
to date.

On the day of discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was alert and oriented to
place and date, with stable and normal VS. Breathing comfortably
and BP in good control on current medication regimen, HDS. On
Neurologic examination, his speech was fluent and he exhibited a
stable mild flattening of his Left NLF, but full power in all
tested muscle groups. He is working with PT and getting out of
bed to chair [**Hospital1 **]. His FSBG were in good control (120-150) on
increased dosing of SSI.
