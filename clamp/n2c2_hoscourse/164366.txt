Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] is a 50 year old man with HIV, CAD, and HTN who
presented with nausea, vomting, diarrhea, weakness, fevers,
chills, pruritis and abdominal pain. He initially required
pressors and IV fluids to support his blood pressure.

1) SIRS:
His presentation with fever, tachycardia, hypotension and an
elevated lactate was thought to be consistent with SIRS.  The
etiology of his SIRS was unclear as his infectious workup was
largely negative with the exception of a potential LLL
pneumonia.  It was thought that this was most likely due to an
anaphylactic reaction to amoxicillin as on further questioning
he endorsed pruritis, facial erythema/edema, and that these
symptoms felt quite similar to an anaphylactic exposure to
bactrim he had several years ago.  Regardless of the etiology he
quickly improved in terms of hemodynamics and lactate level.  He
was continued on levofloxacin and given a prescription to
complete a seven day course to finish on [**2104-10-23**].

2) Abdominal pain/diarrhea/vomiting:
This was thought to be part of his SIRS process and generally
improved during his hospitalization.  A CT scan was negative for
an infectious or inflammatory process.  He still complained of
slight nausea at discharge and was given a prescription for
compazine to use as needed.

3) HIV: He was continued on his HAART regimena and will follow
up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

4) CAD/HTN:
His anti-hypertensives were initially held due to his
hypotension.  At discharge his blood pressure was stable in the
110-150/50-80 range.  At discharge he was restarted on atenolol
at 25 mg daily.  He has a follow-up appointment in [**Company 191**] on
[**2104-9-22**] and at this time he should have his blood pressure
checked and medications adjusted if needed (he was previously
taking metoprolol 50 mg and lisinopril 5 mg).  He was continued
on his aspirin.

5) Hyperlipidemia:
He was restarted on his pravastatin at discharge.
