#. Basilar stroke: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-8-30**]
for acute stroke. He was treated with MERCI and intra-arterial
TPA: The patient's neuro status was closely monitored. He was
transitioned from a heparin gtt to lovenox given recent embolic
stroke and hypercoaguable state in setting of malignancy.  The
patient was cleared for a regular diet after a speech and
swallow evaluation.

#. Right common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm: Patient s/p
mechanical and chemical thrombectomy via right common femoral
artery puncture, and was found to have small right common
femoral artery pseudoaneurysm. He had a repeat ultrasound on
[**2199-9-6**] which showed the pseudoaneurysm had slightly increased
in size from 1.7 to 1.9 mm in the sagittal plane only. Vascular
surgery was following, and did not feel there was a need for
intervention.  The patient's HCT remained stable.

#. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to pleural effusions (malignant).
CXR on [**2199-9-3**] had shown stable reticular nodular pattern in
right lung likely representing lymphatic obstruction, a stable
right pleural effusion, and increased opacification in left lung
likely representing increased atelectasis and increased pleural
effusion. The patient's supplemental O2 was gradually weaned as
tolerated.  Repeat CXR on [**2199-9-8**] showed increased pleural
effusion and patient had a repeat thoracentesis on [**2199-9-11**] prior
to discharge. A post-procedure chest x-ray was done and there
were no complications from the procedure.

#. [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient has h/o bilateral hydronephrosis, likely
secondary to obstructive uropathy. s/p right nephrostomy tube in
08/[**2198**]. Prior to this admission, the patient had been scheduled
for bilateraly stent placement on [**2199-9-12**]. His left stent showed
hematuria and had poor output in setting of creatinine increase
from 1.3->1.7, his left nephrostomy tube was placed. On
discharge, his creatinine was 2.0. This lab test should be
repeated.

#. Stage IV gastric CA: Patient recently diagnosed with gastric
cancer, and gastric biopsy returned positive for poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma infiltrating through the deep
mucosal layer. Cytology from the peripancreatic lymph nodes was
also
positive for malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Patient started first cycle of chemotherapy with epirubicin,
oxaliplatin and capecitabine on [**2199-8-22**]. Given recent
complications in course, chemo currently on hold.  His cell
counts were monitored closely in setting of recent chemo.

#. Atrial Fibrillation: Patient rate-controlled with metoprolol.
Coumadin had been held initially for thoracentesis, and was not
restarted in setting of stroke and low platelet count. Patient
was previously on argatroban gtt, but placed on heparin gtt
after rise in platelets and exclusion of HIT. Patient will need
long-term anticoagulation in setting of recent embolic stroke
and hypercoagulable state.  He was started on lovenox.

#. Hypertension: BP was well-controlled after transfer to
medical oncology service. The patient was continued on
metoprolol for both rate control and BP control.
