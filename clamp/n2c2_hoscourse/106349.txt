55 y/o male with ?viral syndrome vs. other atypical infection
with hypotension that is suspected to be hypovolemia or adrenal
insufficiency, with acute renal failure.
.
# Lethargy: concern for viral syndrome, including activation of
CMV, or a respiratory virus. He has been known EBV+ in the past.
This could also be related to sensation of dyspnea that he has
been having, and warranted further cardiovascular and pulmonary
work-up in parallel with the infectious work-up. In the ICU,
continued broad spectrum antibiotics of vancomycin and aztreonam
(given allergy).  Infectious workup largely negative including
CMV VL, respiratory panel, EBV VL, fungal markers, blood
cultures, urine cultures, CT chest. Pt's lethargy improved with
IVFs, antibiotics, and stress dose steroids. Did not ever need
pressors.
.
# Dyspnea/Cough: Concern for infectious process. Regarding VTE,
his risk should be reduced with therapeutic INR, though the
concern for coumadin failure merits consideration, though would
be unlikely and he has no other signs and symptoms of DVT. PFTs
completed [**9-9**], with official report pending at time of this
summary. CT chest showing resolving parenchymal processes,
resolving infectious/inflammatory process. Continued broad
spectrum antibiotics initially. When no infiltrate noted on CXR,
decreased ABX to 5 days of azithromycin for treatment of
bronchitis.
.
# Hypotension: A bedside "shock" ultrasound US in ED showed no
cardiac effusion, no evidence of gross RV overload. EKG
unchanged. Patient's hypotension was fluid/stress dose steroids
responsive. Initially given stress dose steroids with plans to
resume home dose.  Also given IVF repletion. BPs normalized.
Likely etiology was slight adrenal insufficiency in setting of
viral syndrome despite negative infectious workup. Patient
discharged with prednisone 7.5 mg daily.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Likely pre-renal azotemia. Improved with
IVFs. Cr 0.9 on discharge.
.
# Mild epigastric/RUQ tenderness: No laboratory e/o hepatitis.
RUQ US showing polyp at neck of gallbladder (1.2cm), which was
also seen on prior ultrasound scan [**2145-2-9**]. No other findings
to explain epigastric pain. This pain has resolved on discharge.
.
# Pulmonary Embolism [**11-23**]: continued coumadin with INR goal
[**1-19**].

# Diabetes: Continued NPH 12 units [**Hospital1 **], with close sugar
monitoring and diabetic diet.
