When the pt arrived on the floor she was placed on standing nebs
and prednisone. During the night, pt felt more SOB and
tachypneic. MICU team called for evaluation and the pt was found
to have accessory muscle use while sitting up in bed, tachypnea
to upper 20s, O2 sat 99% RA.  Pt placed on continuous albuterol
neb but subjectively felt her breathing was worse. ABG at that
time was 7.4/39/123/25.  Pt was transferred to the MICU for
further care.
.
In the MICU she was started on IV solumedrol, continuous
nebulized albuterol and heliox for her asthma exacerbation.  Pt
was also placed on levaquin for possible pneumonia.  Pt's
respiratory status improved with increased air entry and was
transitioned to albuterol q1h.  Intubation was not required.
Serial ABGs with pH 7.40-7.46.  Pt experienced sinus tachycardia
in the 120s, BP adequate 100-130/50-80.  Thought to be [**3-4**]
continuous albuterol -> pt switched to xoponex q1h and
ipratroprium q4h.  Pt was able to speak in full sentences and
did not show any signs of accessory muscle use.  PEFR was 250
(baseline 450).  Pt was transferred back to the floor.
.
# Asthma exacerbation: No clear exacebating factors on history
beyond increased stress at work. CXR did not show obvious PNA
but there was an increased R perihilar density.  Pt was
transitioned from IV solumedrol 125mg q8h in the MICU to PO
prednisone 50mg on the floor.  Pt was also continued on
ipratroprium q4h with xoponex nebs q1h prn.  The pt's advair was
held [**3-4**] systemic steroid use.  Pt did well with this therapy
for about a day and then became acutely short of breath with RR
in the high 20's, O2 sat 91% on RA, PEFR 125 and sinus
tachycardia to the 150s.  Pt responded well to 4L O2 by NC, IV
solumedrol 125mg x1, Combivent and IV Ativan 2mg (it was felt
that there was a large component of anxiety contributing to the
pt's respiratory distress).  Pt did well with this episode and
did not require further IV steroids.  Pt continued to do well on
ipratroprium q4h and xoponex nebs q1h prn (pt received roughly
q4h). Outpatient loratidine and flonase were continued to
control her allergies, which could contribute to her
exacerbation.  Pt was able to ambulate with RA O2 sats from
91-93% on [**8-2**].  On the day of discharge pt felt much better, was
ambulating without supplemental O2.  O2 sat on RA was 98%.  PEFR
increased to 250.  Minimal upper-airway wheezing.  Pt will be
discharged with a steroid taper, 50mg qdaily x 5days, 40mg
qdaily x 5days, 30mg qdaily x 5days, 20mg qdaily x 5days and
10mg qdaily until she sees her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will be sent home with
Atrovent nebs q6h prn.

# Pneumonia: CXR was suggestive of pneumonia and pt was treated
with Levaquin 750 mg IV for 5 days.  Pt had ? history of MRSA
pneumonia although there were no records of this.  WBC trended
down after treatment with ABX.  Sputum cultures showed 3+ gram+
cocci in pairs/cluster and 2+ gram+ rods.  This expectorated
sample was adequate (<10 sq epis), however it was collected
after multiple doses of Levaquin.  Clinically pt improved, using
incentive spirometry and ambulating as tolerated with RA O2 sats
from 91-93% on [**8-2**].  RA O2 sats 98% on the day of discharge.
Final sputum culture revealed growth of oropharyngeal flora.
.
# Tachycardia: Pt had sinus tachycardia in the MICU to the 120s
and on the floor peaked to the 150s.  There were multiple causes
of her tachycardia - hypoxemia, continuous albuterol nebs in the
MICU, anxiety, pain and possible infection.  Pt was not anemic
or febrile (on steroids) and clinically she did not appear
hypovolemic.  No EKG changes were noted.  Pt was monitored on
telemetry.  Pt's tachycardia improved after d/c of albuterol and
as her exacerbation was treated with steroids and nebulizers.
.
# Bipolar Disease: Pt not currently manic or depressed.  Pt was
continued on her outpatient fluoxetine, trazodone, thorazine,
and carbamazepine.
.
# Bulimia: Pt had poor PO intake [**3-4**] pain and SOB according to
the pt.  She was continued on her outpatient naltrexone.
.
# Thrush: Treated with nystatin.
.
# Hypothyroidism: On [**5-9**] TSH was 3.9. Outpatient levothyroxine
was continued.
.
# B12 Deficiency: Pt receives vit B12 monthly inj.
.
# FEN/GI: Pt was started on Vitamin D and Calcium given her
recurrent use of systemic steroids. Pt should continue vitamin D
and calcium as an outpatient, if she needs a prescription she
can follow with her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] tolerated a regular diet, K was
repleted once (K 3.3) with 40meq KCl x1, continued on outpatient
ranitidine.
.
# PPx: Maintained on heparin sc, bowel regimen, ranitidine.
.
# Access - PIV
.
# Code - Full
