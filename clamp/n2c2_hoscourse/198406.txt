[**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for
CAD, critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a
fall with a humeral fracture and hypotension following opiates.
.
# Hypotension: Patient was found to be hypotensive in the ED
after coming back from radiology study.  The etiologies for her
hypotension were thought to be related to pain-medications and
critical AS.  Patient was given gental IV fluid boluses after
being admitted to CCU.  Patient's blood pressure continued to be
low, systolics in the 60s and 70s, during the rest of her
hospital stay.  Pressors were avoided given her severe AS.
Because of hypotension, she developed acute renal failure
rapidly (creatinine bumped from 0.9 to 2.9 in 2 days).  Patient
declined hemodialysis, also denied AVR or valvuloplasty, so
after extensive discussions with patient's HCP (her son, [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 10166**]), decision was made to make patient comfort measures only.
She expired on day 3 of her hospital stay from acute renal
failure and electrolyte abnormalities.
.
# Critical AS: The patient had a previous valve area of 0.7cm2.
She underwent a repeat TTE which showed critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).  She declined AVR or
valvuloplasty.  She expired on [**2146-2-2**] in the setting of
critical AS, hypotension and acute renal failure.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from labs
but appeared to be around 0.6-0.7.  Patient's creatinine was 0.9
on admission, likely prerenal in the context of appearing dry.
No recent antibiotics or other nephrotoxins, and no symptoms of
UTI with benign UA.  Patient was hypotensive during her hospital
stay.  As a result, her kidney function deteriorated rapidly.
Her creatinine bumped to 2.9 on day 3.  Patient declined
hemodialysis, so she was made comfort measures only after all
medical options to keep her alive failed.  On the morning of her
expiration, her K was 5.4, and she was not producing urine.  She
passed at 1900 that day.  It is therefore very likely that she
died of hyperkalemia.  On telemetry, she went into brief VT
followed by asystole minutes before her demise.
.
# Fall: Etiology of fall was unclear. The most concerning
possibility was that patient's AS led to syncope due to
hypoperfusion. Unfortunately, as the fall was unwitnessed and
the patient did not remember what happened this was impossible
to prove. Patient underwent a repeat TTE which showed critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).  Therefore, it was
certainly very likely that AS played a role in the fall.
.
# Humeral Fracture: Patient was seen by Orthopedics in the ED.
Ortho decided to manage conservatively with sling and analgesia.
Pain control was achieved with tylenol around the clock,
lidocaine patch, and low dose dilaudid with a goal to minimize
effect on blood pressure.  Patient's pain was well-controlled on
the above regimen.
.
# Rhythm: Patient was in atrial fibrillation, and not
anticoagulated. She was not on aspirin or coumadin because of a
previous GI bleed.  Metoprolol was held given her hypotension.
Patient was observed on telemetry during her hospital stay in
CCU.  She went into VT followed by asystole minutes before she
expired, likely secondary to hyperkalemia in the setting of
acute renal failure.
.
# Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology, though rapid increase and lack
of fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggested possibly
leukemoid reaction in the context of fracture and injury.
Cultures were negative, including blood cx, urine cx and c.diff.
 Patient was not started on antibiotics since she had no sign of
infection.
.
# Anemia: Patient had history of normocytic anemia, baseline
around 29-20.  Her hct was 43.6 on admission, likely
hemoconcentrated.  Hct decreased to her baseline of 29 during
the next two days.  She had no signs of active bleeding.
.
# CAD: Patient reported history of CAD, but with minimal details
and there are no caths in our system. Patient was not on ASA or
statin (lipids normal). Patient had some cardiac enzyme leaks
during her hospital stay, likely in the setting of hypotension
and decreased blood supply to coronaries.
.
# PPx: Patient was given subcutaneous heparin for DVT
prophylaxis.
.
# FEN: Patient was given cardiac healthy diet during this
hospital stay.
.
# CODE: DNR/DNI (discussed with patient and son-HCP)
