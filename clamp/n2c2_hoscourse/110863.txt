85-year-old man with Kaposi's sarcoma with visceral involvement,
CHF, CKD presents with confusion, dyspnea, odynophagia,
generalized weakness.
.
#. Goals of Care: Patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia
to the high 80s from pulmonary edema and the plan to initiate
dialysis to remove fluid. The patient did receive one round of
dialysis before he and his family decided to change his goals of
care. While in the ICU, it was decided that the patient would be
made comfort measures only. The patient was started on a
Morphine drip, Benadryl for itching related uremia, and Haldol
for terminal delirium. The patient was subsequently transfered
to the oncology inpatient service.  Pt expired the following
night.
.
#. Dyspnea: Patient presented with some wheezing on exam,
bilateral crackles R>L. CT showed right-sided pleural effusion.
Intermittently tachypneic but with good O2 saturation. There is
no clear evidence of pneumonia. Patient does not have
significant coughs and the chest CT showed no clear infiltrate.
Antibiotics were discontinued on the oncology service. The
patient received nebs prn. Patient further received Furosemide
given concern for CHF on exam.  Pt had one round of dialysis but
did not resolve pt's tachypnea.
.
#. Confusion: Not at home but started being delirious at [**Hospital1 9487**]. Might be due to hospitalization-related delirium
in an elderly person, CHF exacerbation, pneumonia. Head bleed is
a possible cause given thrombocytopenia. Uremia (urea > 100)
from CKD was ultimately presumed to be the most likely cause.
.
#. HTN: Normotensive on admission. The patient was continued on
Hydralazine, Labetolol and Ranolazine initially, though these
meds were held for hypotension that may likely happen with
dialysis.
.
#. Odynophagia: Was presumed due to mucositis from recent
chemotherapy. Patient received pain control with narcotics and
was monitored closely for thrush. Pt was also started on Fluc
and Acyclovir.
.
#. CKD: Cr 4.0 at baseline but urea in the 130s from the usual
80s. The patient subsequently received one round of dialysis
before his goals of care were changed.
.
#. Kaposi's sarcoma with known visceral involvement: Patient was
pancytopenic from recent chemotherapy. Pt was started on
Neupogen and WBC responded appropriately.
.
# Pt was on pneumoboots for DVT ppx as pt had thrombocytopenia.
Pt was DNR/DNI on admission, then made CMO in ICU.  Pt was NPO
given high risk of aspiration.
