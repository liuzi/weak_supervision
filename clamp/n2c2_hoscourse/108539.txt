58 year old with a PMH significant for non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy, chronic a-fib, and ventricullar tachycardia s/p
AICD placement on [**2122-5-26**], that was transferred from [**Hospital 107**]
Hospital in RI for treatment of ventricular tachycardia with
ablation.
.
# Ventricular tachycardia/dialated cardiomyopathy: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has
ventricular tachycardia in the setting of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy.  These episodes of ventricular tachycardia
started in [**2122-5-21**], he is s/p AICD placement and has had
several instances recently of firing of his AICD.  Etiology of
his v-tach is likely cardiomyopathy resulting in ectopy.  An
initial echo was done the morning after admission and showed
dilated left ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction, also
right ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Hemodynamically
stable and asymptomatic.  He was conitnued on an amiodarone drip
of 0.5mg/min until he was taken for EP procedure on [**2122-7-23**].
During the study, they were beginning to warm a site for
ablation, and he went into fast VT, so the study was aborted.
He converted back to his normal rhythm.  His amiodarone was
converted to 200mg PO TID and he still had VT with walking
minimal distances, therefore loading dose was increased to 400mg
[**Hospital1 **], with plan to transition to 200mg PO BID in one week
(starting [**2122-8-1**]).  Now currently undergoing workup for heart
transplant.  CT chest completed which showed multifocal small
ground-glass nodules predominantly involving the upper lobes,
requiring a follow up repeat CT in [**2-24**] weeks as an outpatient.
CT abd/pelvis showed hypoattenuating left upper pole renal
lesion, most likely benign, but a renal US could be considered
as an outpatient.  Hepatitis A,B,C, CMV and HIV serologies were
negative.

While on the floor [**2122-7-27**] and [**2122-7-28**] he had increased runs of
VTach resulting in AICD firing.  The device fired once on [**2122-7-27**]
at 9:30 in the morning when he was walking with the EP team to
reproduce symptoms.  On the 7th, he was washing his hair sitting
at the sink and he became symptomatic with lightheadedness and
flushing.  He had 2 runs of VTach that both resulted in ICD
firings at 8:09 and 8:10 in the morning.  He was taken to cath
immediately following, and then he was taken to the EP lab for
readjustment of his leads.  The lead wires were adjusted to
remove slack from the wires.  He tolerated the procedure well
and has been without any runs of VTach since.

He received a TTE on [**2122-7-29**] when compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2122-7-22**], biventricular systolic cavity
sizes are smaller and systolic function is slightly improved to
30-35%. A right/left heart cardiac catheterization that showed:
right dominant system that demonstrated no angiongraphically
apparent disease. The LMCA, LAD, LCx and RCA had no evidence of
angiographically apparent disease. Resting hemodyanamics
revealed slightly elevated right sided filling pressures with
RVEDP of 15mmHg.  Cardiac output was preserved at 7 l/min. His
volume status was medically managed and he was transitioned back
to his home PO Lasix of 20mg daily.
.
# Contact dermatitis/cellulitis: He developed a likely contact
dermatitis after lead replacement at OSH.  The contact
dermatitis may have been from the chlorhexadine prep during the
procedure as the patient reported that this happened in the past
during a prior cath.  The contact dermatitis likely became
super-infected and he developed erispelas which was treated
successfully with doxycyline for 7 days last dose [**2122-7-28**].
.
# Atrial fibrillation: His atrial fibrillation was rate
controlled and medically managed.  His coumadin was held
secondary to need for cardiac catheterization and he was placed
on a heparin drip throughout his admission.
.
# Sleep apnea: His sleep apnea was medically managed with his
CPAP mask at night without complications.
.
The patient was full code for this admission. Pt was discharged
home with further outpt follow-up planned.
