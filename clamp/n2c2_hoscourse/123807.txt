ACUTE ON CHRONIC LUMBOSACRAL RADICULOPATHY: Despite
multimodality pain regimen, the patient's pain remained poorly
controlled, except when treated with ketorolac. Unfortunately,
this is a potentially dangerous medication in this woman with
advanced age, mildly reduced renal function, and on warfarin and
plavix. A pain consult was obtained, but they did not add much
to the present management.

MRI of LS spine showed no evidence of nerve root impingement,
cauda equina or canal stenosis, but incidental note was made of
a possible left pelvic mass. This was further evaluated by
CT....

...It is possible that some of the pain and weakness may be
related to an iliopsoas process.
.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: related to NSAID's and dehydration
.
.
PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Continue warfarin goal INR [**12-31**].
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Stable - plavix, statin, toprol.
OSTEOPOROSIS: Vitamin D, q month Boniva
HYPERTENSION: Continue outpatient medications

____________________________________
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course and subsequent medical service course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of Afib, CVA, CAD
initially admitted on [**9-5**] with worsening low back pain who
became hypotensive to 80's systolic this evening. Of note, this
morning she had a CT scan that showed an RP bleed. This was
thought to be [**12-30**] increased INR and she was given 1 mg sc
vitamin k and 2 mg po vitamin k. No recent procedures. No change
in medications. Her coumadin was given on [**9-5**] but held since
[**9-6**] because of increased INR. She also is hyponatremic which
was thought to be iatrogenic from D51/2 NS maintenance fluids
given continuously despite an initial sodium of 128 on
admission. Her urine lytes show urine na < 10 and osm >300. Her
sodium is up from 117-->121 with NS bolus. Patient herself feels
well. She denies LH, dizziness, cp, palp, sob, abd pain, nausea,
vomiting, back pain.  On the floor, she was given 2 u ffp, 1 u
prbcs and 500 cc normal saline bolus. She initially improved
with SBP high 90s to low 100s. BP recheck an hour later was in
the 80s again and her crit prior to blood transfusion came back
at 16 so she was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and
bleed.
.
In the ICU, her initial vs were: T 96 BP 122/49, HR 79, O2 sat
96% RA, R 16. She reported feeling well. Denied LH, dizziness,
cp, sob, abd or back pain.

[**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, afib on coumadin
with supratherapeutic INR presented with hypotension in setting
of RP bleed and hematocrit drop.

#. RP Bleed: Seen on CT scan.  Repeat CT-scan w/ contrast did
not show expansion of the hematoma or evidence of active bleed.
Likely in setting of elevated INR ?????? no trauma by history. Given
2U pRBCs during admission. Hematocrit stable over rest of
hospital course.  Conservative management.
-*Given patient's significant retroperitoneal bleed with hct
drop and hypotension, the patient's coumadin, aspirin and plavix
were all discontinued. I recommend that patient not be restarted
on coumadin in the future.  In my opinion, the risk of recurrent
significant RP bleed outweighs the cardioembolic benefits in the
setting of the patient's a-fib.  The patient can be restarted on
aspirin +/- plavix per PCP discretion at future outpatient PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **].*

#. Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  The patient converted from
sinus rhythm to a-fib on [**9-10**] with subsequent RVR up to the
140s.  This was in the setting of RP bleed, holding of her
beta-blocker, the stress of medical illness.  Cardiology was
consulted to assist in management. Metoprolol was uptitrated to
75 mg po qid after which the patient eventually spontaneously
converted to sinus rhythm in the early am of [**9-14**].  At time of
discharge, the patient was discharged on metoprolol 100 mg po
bid in sinus rhythm.
-Patient will require further downtitration of her metoprolol by
PCP at [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u outpatient visits.

#  HTN, benign:
*Of note, the patient's amlodipine, aliskeren, and valsartan
were all held at time of discharge given focus on maximizing
beta-blockade for rate control.  These can be selectively
restarted as desired by the patient's PCP at [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u outpatient PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **].*

#. Acute Diastolic heart failure/pulmonary edema: Occurred twice
following transfusion of blood products > causing flash
pulmonary edema. Pt again became SOB after blood products,
improved with lasix and morphine.  Patient's also a-fib with RVR
in setting of diastolic heart failure contributed.  With further
gentle lasix and rate-control, the patient reached euvolemia.
The patient was not discharged on lasix.

# Low back pain: No neurologic defecits on exam. Her low back
pain may have been [**12-30**] this RP bleed as her L spine imaging on
admission showed a ? left pelvic mass. Has history of chronic
low back pain.

# Coagulopathy- Patient had supratherapeutic INR during
admission.  Coumadin was held and subsequently discontinued.

# CAD: Admission EKG wnl. Continued statin on d/c, d/'d asa and
plavix until PCP f/u.

# Hypothyroidism: Cont levothyroxine

# Code:  Full Code, confirmed with HCP
