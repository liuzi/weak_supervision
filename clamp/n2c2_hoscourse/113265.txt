Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 54 yo female with no significant past medical
history who initially presented with back pain, urinary
retention on [**7-3**], found to have multiple epidural abscesses s/p
multiple surgical debridements with hospital course complicated
by episodes of flash pulmonary/respiratory compromise requiring
intubation and febrile neutropenia secondary to lasix and
vancomycin administration.
.
# Bacteremia/Abscesses/Antibiotic therapy
.
Patient initially presented with back pain, associated urinary
retention and LE weakness. Admission imaging positive for
cervical and lumbar epidural abscesses (though patient with no
known risk factors). She was empirically started on
vancomycin/cefepime/levofloxacin. She underwent C2-C6/T12-L2
bilateral laminectomies with insertion of 4 drains on [**2135-7-3**].
She subsequently developed a septic right knee and returned to
the OR on [**2135-7-4**] for right knee washout. Regarding further
initial infectious work-up at that time: a TEE was obtained
which showed no vegetations; CT head without evidence of
intracranial abscess.
.
On [**2135-7-6**], antibiotic coverage was narrowed to nafcillin when
cultures from abscesses, right knee, and blood grew MSSA.
However, due to signs and symptoms of leukocytosis, hypoxia
there was concern for hospital acquired pneumonia and antibiotic
coverage was broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, and
ciprofloxacin on [**7-10**]. Patient remained febrile. Surveillance
imaging obtained on [**7-12**] which demonstrated increased epidural
collection within anterior cervical epidural space and
displacement of the cervical cord. The patient returned to the
OR on [**7-13**] for abscess decompression and evacuation and fusion
of C3-4, C4-5, and C5-6. After reviewing microbial date with all
cultures + MSSA, her antibiotic coverage was again narrowed to
nafcillin.
.
Patient had been doing well with normalized temperature and WBC
however four days after starting nafcillin, developed a
abdominal rash. Derm was consulted, biopsies were taken which
were c/w drug rash secondary to nafcillin. Nafcillin was
subsequently discontinued and replaced by IV vancomycin.
.
Repeat MR spine with new paraspinal fluid collections, and mild
epidural fluid collection throughout the spine. Due to concern
for continued infection cefepime was added to antibiotic
regimen. On [**7-25**], the patient underwent paraspinal abscess
drainage by interventional radiology. Follow-up CT torso was
obtained on [**8-1**] due to persistent fevers on cefepime and vanc;
finding were stable to previous imaging and cefepime was
discontinued. On [**8-5**], her C-collar was removed. Surveilance MR
C/T-Spine on [**8-6**] showed stable epidural enhancement and
abscesses identified in the anterior cervical region, thoracic
region without epidural abscess. CT scan on [**8-9**] demonstrated
left iliopsoas abscess/phlegmen and left thigh fluid collection;
both of which were too small to be drained by IR.
.
Unfortunately side effects necessitated further antibiotic
adjustment. CBC with noted leukopenia on [**8-5**] with progression
to neutropenia [**8-8**].  Out of concern that vancomycin could be
contributing to decreasing counts, vanc d/c'ed  and IV
daptomycin started. Per ID will plan to treat MSSA
bacteremia/abscesses with IV daptomycin to total of 6-8wk
course. At time of discharge utility of repeat imaging
discussed. Plan to repeat CT abd/pelvis; MRI spine further into
antibiotic treatment.
.
# Febrile Neutropenia
.
Patient's WBC count began to slowly decline on [**8-5**] with
progression to neutropenia on [**8-8**]. Neutropenia was felt
secondary to medication effect; subsequently omeprazole,
furosemide, vancomycin and seroquel were discontinued.
Hematology was consulted, and felt that furosemide or vancomycin
were likely offending agents. Antibiotic coverage altered on
[**8-8**]: vancomycin discontinued and daptomycin started for
treatment of MSSA. On [**8-9**] she was febrile 102.6 and meropenem
started for treatment of neutropenic fever. GCSF initiated.
After administration of GCSF counts slowly became to rise and
fevers abated. GCSF was stopped on [**8-14**] when ANC>1000 for more
than 48hrs.
.
Respiratory Distress
.
On admission patient found to be tachypnic. LENIs negative. On
[**7-8**], developed worsening tachypnea and hypoxemia (95% on 4L by
nasal canula). The patient diureased 500ml on IV Lasix and
improved slightly. CTA ruled out PE, however showed evidence of
bilateral loculated pleural effusions and multiple lung nodules.
Cardiac enzymes negative. Pro-BNP 2777 on [**7-8**]. Estimated EF by
TEE was >55%; 2 repeat echos without evidence of valvular
pathology. In MICU, IV Lasix and morphine lessened respiratory
distress. On [**7-10**], transferred to the floor; latered became
hypoxic and was transfered back to the MICU and started on
BiPAP. Pleural effusion studies suggested parapneumonic
effusion. Patient intubated and extubated several time while in
MICU. On [**7-16**], the patient was again extubated. She developed
hypertension to 180 SBP and respiratory distress secondary to
pulm edema, which responded to lasix and labetolol. On [**7-19**], she
was comfortable oxygenating with only nasal cannula. She was
electively intubated on [**7-25**] for paraspinal abscess drainage and
extubated post-procedure. Unfortunately, again developed
worsening hypercarbic respiratory distress, requiring
reintubation on [**7-27**].  She was gently diuresed, in an effort to
decrease the work of breathing. On [**8-3**] she was succesfully
extubated, satting well on face mask. On [**8-5**] she was weaned to
NC. CT on [**8-9**] showed improvement in pleural effusions and
basilar consolidations. She continued to do well on supplemental
oxygen by nasal cannula. On the floor her oxygen requirement was
weaned. She had one episode of flash pulmonary edema, during
which she desaturated to high 80s. She was diuresed with bumex
with good effect. For the remainder of her stay, team allowed
for auto-diuresis. At time of discharge patient saturating 94%
RA, >95% 1L.
.
# Blood Pressure
.
During MICU stay pt had repeated episodes of transient
bradycardia and hypotension as well as episodes of paroxysmal
hypertension into the SBP 180-200s. Her hypertension responded
to 5mg-10mg doses of IV labetalol. After significiant diuresis,
her SBP remained stable in the 150-160s. On the floor, BP ran
consistently high. Patient was started on metoprolol and
amlodipine. These medications were gradually uptitrated and at
time of discharge pressures were better controlled on metoprolol
50mg TID, amlopidine 10mg QD. She was transitioned to toprol xl
150mg daily at the time of discharge.
.
# Nutrition
.
Patient underwent severeal video swallowing evaluation due to
concern for silent aspiration. In the MICU, several methods of
nutrition employed: NG tube feeds as well as PPN. On transfer to
floor patient on NG tube feeds. Repeat speech and swallow on
[**8-15**] demonstrated improved oral and pharyngeal swallow with
continued swallow delay, premature spillover and reduced base of
tongue retraction. Patient continued to aspirate thin liquids
silently, but speech deemed it safe to initiate a PO diet of
nectar thick liquids and moist, ground solids with the
aspiration precautions documented below. It is important to note
aspiration is silent,
and she will need continued speech therapy follow up with likely
repeat video swallow before advancing her diet.

# Delirium
.
In the MICU observed waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status worse at
night and with spikes in fever. Symptoms improved with zyprexa
at night. The pt became more alert following extubation on [**8-3**],
however, she had some disorientation. She received several doses
of seroquel, which was discontinued when the patient became
neutropenic, as it can be a potential cause of leukopenia.  Over
the course of the next few days, her became more alert and
interactive.  By time of transfer from MICU to floor on [**8-10**],
she was fully oriented and had a good understanding of the
medical plan. On the floor, patients mentation continued to
improve. At time of discharge patient mental status was clear
and coherent.
.
# Elbow mass
.
Mass noted on right elbow.  Derm consulted; felt to be
consistent with lipoma.
.
# UTI:  She developed low grade fevers on [**8-21**] to 100.4,
prompting urinalysis, which demonstrated UTI.  She will complete
a 10 day course of ciprofloxacin 500mg [**Hospital1 **] to end [**2135-9-1**].
