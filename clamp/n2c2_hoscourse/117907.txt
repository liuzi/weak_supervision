Pt admitted to ICU. Intubated.
1. Septic shock: GPC thought to be from line infection vs a
pulmonary source.  He was started on Vanco CTX, and Gent, with
requirement of pressor support for hypotension. Renal was
consulted and a decision was made to attempt to treat without
pulling the line.  The patient was weaned off of pressors.
Discussion with the patient's girlfriend revealed that he had
been having large volume diarrhea prior to being found on the
floor. Further discussion with surgery ensued and pt was slated
to go to the OR on [**7-4**] for evaluation of the infected graft
stump.

In early AM on [**7-4**], pt found to be in asystole. Immediately
started on pressors and IVF for hypotension.  Rhythm changed to
Vtach, labs sent and pt found to have hyperkalemia, started on
Bicarb, Insulin, glucose.  Rhythm returned to asystole, code
called, pt pronounced deceased at 4:10AM.
