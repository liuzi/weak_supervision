A/P: 56 year old woman with a history of cognitive delay, DMII,
recently diagnosed Crohn's disease on prednisone, probable
latent TB on INH, MRSA bacteremia from PICC on daptomycin (last
dose [**2131-9-24**]), who was admitted with hypoglycemia related to an
increase in her antihypoglycemic medications, with course
complicated by viral pneumonia and respiratory distress, now
resolved.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Hypoglycemia: Her presentation was related to aggressive
increase in oral hypoglycemics, after her hypoglycemic
medication dosages had been recently increased. She was treated
with D50 IV and her anti-hypoglycemics were held, glucose
normalized and her mental status returned to baseline. She was
maintained on a sliding scale insulin while in hospital.  She
was discharged on antihypoglycemic regimen from prior to
medication increases prior to admission. We recommend continued
monitoring of her finger glucose and gradually increase
glipizide or pioglitazone as needed.
.
# Viral Pneumonia: On [**2131-9-23**], the patient was triggered for
tachypnea and increased work of breathing. Her CXR was
concerning for HCAP as well as vascular congestion. Patient
received 20mg of IV lasix as well as nebs. Antibiotics broadened
to cefepime, but had persistent tachypnea, with CXR
demonstrating worsening bilateral infiltrates. Again received
nebs, Lasix 20mg IV (last dose at MN) with UOP 1L. She continued
to have worsening respiratory function and was transferred to
the MICU in obvious respiratory distress with accessory muscle
use and audible grunting. The decision was made to electively
intubate with anesthesia/respiratory at bedside. During
intubation patient paralyzed with succ with initial transient
hypotension to the 70s. Uncomplicated intubation performed and
patient sedated with propofol and fentanyl.  The cause of her
respiratory decompensation was probably multifactorial.  Her
antibiotics were broadened to linezolid/cefepime/levofloxacin
for possible multifocal pneumonia.  Given CXR evidence of
bilateral pulmonary edema, cardiogenic source was suspected and
she was diuresed.  TTE revealed normal left ventricular function
but right ventricular overload thought to be related to her
acute pneumonic process.  She underwent bronchoscopy on [**2131-9-24**]
which revealed +yeast, +PMN, and +rhinovirus, but no PCP or
bacteria.  Her rhinovirus may have contributed to her diffuse
inflammatory process.  PCP was [**Name Initial (PRE) **] concern due to her
unprophylaxed chronic steroid load of 30mg prednisone daily, and
indeed a beta glucan was positive, though this was felt to
represent her candidida from her lung.  Her linezolid and
cefepime were discontinued, and she was continued on
levofloxacin 8d course for possible bacterial suprainfection.
She was successfully extubated on [**9-26**] and transferred to the
medicine service on [**9-27**], where she completed levofloxacin
course, oxygen staturation remained in the upper 90's on room
air, she ambulated the [**Doctor Last Name **] without dyspnea. She was discharged
with dextromethorphan-guaifenesin as needed for cough.
.
# Acute kidney injury: Baseline creatinine 0.7, she was admitted
with creatinine 1.8 related to dehydration. Lisinopril was held,
she was treated with intervenous fluids and her creatinine
improved. Lisinopril was resumed.
.
# Rash: Diffuse livido reticularis appearing rash. She was seen
by dermatology and it was felt to be a reaction to her
vancomycin, and she was switched to daptomycin and started on
topical triamcinolone and hydrocortisone and the rash improved.
.
# Urinary Tract Infection: Her urine culture revealed
pan-sensitive E. coli and Klebsiella, which was treated with her
levofloxacin regimen she took for possible bacterial
suprainfection of her viral pneumonia.
.
# MRSA bacteremia: High-grade bacteremia believed to be [**1-31**] to
prior PICC now removed or endocarditis for which she was to
complete a 6 weeks of vancomycin on [**2131-9-24**]. She was switched
to daptomycin on [**9-17**] following the onset of a new rash that
was believed to be vancomycin-related, and completed daptomycin
course on [**9-24**].
.
# Leukocytosis: Throughout hospital course, WBC ranged 9-19, the
day prior to discharge, WBC had trended up to 15 from 13. She
was kept an additional night and a basic infectious workup was
performed. Chest xray looked improved, UA was negative, and
blood cultures showed no growth in 24 hours. The following
morning ([**2131-10-2**]), WBC trended to 13, she was clinically well
appearing and was discharged. Leukocyutosis is likely related to
prednisone.

# Crohns disease:  Increased prednisone to 40mg, and have since
resumed home 30mg dose.  Started on atovaquone for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
.
# TB treatment: Prior to admission, patient had indeterminant
QuantiFERON Gold test.Patient was continued on treatment for
LTBI with isoniazid/B6 Day #1 = [**2131-8-16**] for 9 months.  These
medicaitons should be discontinued after the 9 month course is
complete.
.
# Depression: Held home sertraline while on linezolid to prevent
serotonin syndrome. She became progressively anxious and
tearful. Resumed sertraline 250mg after confirming dose with
health care proxy and [**Name2 (NI) **] improved. No signs of serotonin
syndrome.
.
# Hepatitis B: Patient is Hep B surface antigen positive.
Continued home dose lamivudine 100 mg daily.
.
# Hypertension: Held lisinopril briefly due to [**Last Name (un) **]. Lisinopril
was resumed prior to discharge with adequate control.
.
# Asthma: Continued home fluticasone-salmeterol and started on
albuterol nebulizers.
.
# Glaucoma: Continued home Latanoprost

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-routine follow-up with GI for Crohn's, infliximab treatment
-titration of her diabetes regimen with careful monitoring of
her blood glucose level
-follow-up with hepatology
- Follow up blood cultures [**2131-10-1**] which had shown no growth in
24 hours at the time of d/c
- Follow up acid fast culture from BAL [**2131-9-24**]
