The patient was initially admitted to the Oncology service and
evaluated by the Ortho spine team. He was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service and taken to the Operating Room for
the above procedure without complication. For details please
refer to the dictated operative note. TEDs / pneumoboots were
used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics
were continued for 24hrs postoperatively per standard protocol.
The patient's pain was controlled with IV pain medications
followed by oral analgesics once tolerating POs. The patient's
diet was advanced as tolerated. The foley was removed on POD2.
Physical therapy was consulted for mobilization.
.
On POD2 the patient was noted to have hypotension to SBPs 90's
associated with tachycardia to 110's and hypoxia 90's on RA and
a low grade fever.  At CT chest was negative for PE.  He was
transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring given his
metastatic CA history and started on empiric IV antibiotics.  He
was stable in the ICU and improved with IVF and transferred out
to the floor.
.
On the floor, the pt was persistently febrile, although his
fever curve was trending downwards by abx day 6. The plan was to
continue an 8 day empiric course of vanc/ceftazidime, although
Cx were all negative and even CT torso failed to reveal a
source. Pain control became an issue, particularly left shoulder
pain. Pt is known to have metastatic disease. He required enough
short-acting pain morphine to warrant starting MS Contin, which
was uptitrated. However, pt became more somnolent, but still
complained of pain when he was awoke. He had episodes of
hypotension to the 80s requiring boluses. He ultimately was
given Narcan for his somnolence. He woke immediately, but began
to complain of chest tightness. He was suctioned deeply for
suspected mucous plug, but was intermittently desaturating, even
on 6L NC. He was transferred to the MICU, where he was intubated
immediately as was unresponsive and unable to protect his
airway.

# Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Initial ABG revealed
significant hypercapnia in setting of narcotics and altered
mental status, so hypoxic respiratory failure was initially
attributed to hypoventilation. As stated above, he was
immediately intubated upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and continued on
broad antibiotics. He remained on mechanical ventilation. It was
then noticed that his endotracheal tube appeared high. On
bronchoscopy a new necrotic obstructing mass was noticed in his
airway causing tracheal deviation. It was unlikely to be
procedure-related trauma, given appearance of the obstruction.
Most likely the patient experienced an acute bleed of a necrotic
tumor, which compressed his airway and led to inability to
provide adequate mechanical ventilation. This ultimately led to
his expiration.
.
# Hypotension: On the evening of arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient
began to experience labile blood pressures, dropping to the 80s
systolic while sleeping and climbing to the 140s systolic when
awakened. He was given two 1L NS fluid boluses without change in
his hemodynamics. Transient hypotension was initially attributed
to the use of Propofol for sedation (subsequently changed to
Fentanyl/Midazolam) and perhaps large amounts of pain medication
that were slow to clear secondary to impaired liver and renal
function. He was started on peripheral dopamine for pressure
support.
.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Thought likely secondary to Contrast
Nephropathy based on timing and urine electrolytes. He continued
to have adequate urine output and his Creatinine trended down.
.
# Metastatic Adenocarcinoma: Suspected lung primary and known
bony and liver mets. The patient had undergone 6 cycles of
taxol/carboplatin. He also underwent a T5-8 laminectomy for
suspected cord compression secondary to a spinal met on [**4-29**]. He
suffered tremendous pain from his extensive disease, which was
controlled with Fentanyl boluses in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
# Coronary Artery Disease: EKGs obtained were consistent with
prior and showed no evidence of acute ischemia. He was ruled out
for myocardial infarction with two negative sets of cardiac
biomarkers.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus: On oral anti-hyperglycemics at home, which
were held. Fingersticks were checked q6h and insulin provided as
needed.
.
# Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic inflammation from
underlying malignancy. Hct remained stable.
