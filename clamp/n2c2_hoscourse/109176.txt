30F hx [**Doctor Last Name **] and idiopathic neutropenic who was recently d/c
s/p neck I&D of an infected abscess, now readmitted with
increased drain output and night sweats.  Found with
reaccumulated fluid collection and s/p I&D/washout on [**3-14**].

#Neck abscess: Pt presented to the ED after having previously
undergone a left neck incision for a posterior parapharyngeal
abscess on [**2124-3-4**]. She was treated with IV antibiotics and
discharged with a PICC line and continued ertapenem. She
re-presented on [**2124-3-14**] to the emergency room noting several
days of increasing swelling around the surgical site with
increasing drainage and pain, as well as night sweats and
fevers. CT scan of the neck showed reaccumulation of fluid in
her left cervical region concerning for worsening infection, and
patient was taken emergently to OR by ENT for L neck exploration
and incision and drainage. Procedure was well-tolerated and
proceeded without issue; 3 penrose drains were placed. No
fevers/chills while in house and no signs of sepsis. Was able to
protect airway, breath/swallow comfortably post-op. Per ID, it
was not felt that this episode was antibiotic failure, so she
was continued on meropenem.  She continued to spike temps >101
for the first few days post-op and eventually her fever curve
downtrended.  The penrose drains were removed every 1-2 days
until the final drain was removed on [**2124-3-24**]. Her wound and blood
cultures did not grow any organisms. Pt was treated with
meropenem while hospitalized with initial plan to switch to
ertapenem 2 days prior to discharge. However, LFTs were found to
be elevated on [**2124-3-24**] and [**2124-3-25**], which ID felt may be due to
ertapenem. Pt was then switched to daptomycin with improvement
of her LFTs. She was discharged on daptomycin for an indefinite
treatment course as will be defined by her infectious disease
doctors.

# [**Month/Day/Year **]: LFTs were elevated on [**2124-3-24**] w/ AST 192, AST
184, AP 310, and normal T bili 0.7. Pt's LFTs were also elevated
during prior admission when she was on meropenem and
hydromorphone for pain control. She has also received several
grams of acetaminophen daily during this hospitalization.
Suspect that this is due to a drug effect. Acetaminophen was
stopped and hydromorphone reduced, but LFTs continued ot
increase. Abdominal exam completely benign. RUQ ultrasound also
showed no obvious pathology. ID felt that ertapenem may be
contributing to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was switched for
daptomycin on [**2124-3-26**] with prompt resolution.

#Neutropenia of unknown cause: Baseline WBC per report ~1.8,
unclear etiology for her leukopenia.  Had follow-up with
heme/onc for a ? of WHIM syndrome, was planned for a bone marrow
biopsy as an outpatient.  ANCs were trended throughout without
requiring neupogen administration.  She will follow-up in
outpatient hematology with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**] in mid [**Month (only) **].
