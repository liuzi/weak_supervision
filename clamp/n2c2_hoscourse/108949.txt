# Angioedema/ airway compromise: While on the floor, the pt's
throat and cheeks and neck began to swell.  Two days later, on
[**2181-6-10**], his blood pressure dropped to 50/palp.  He was given 3L
NS and his BP rebounded to the 80's.  However, his O2 sats
dropped to 90% on 4L and he was transferred to the ICU for
further management of his hypotension/ hypoxia/ angioedema. A CT
of the neck was negative for abscess, however soft tissue
inflammation was seen. Pt's O2 requirement was felt to likely
related to airway compromise from severe facial/neck swelling.
He underwent fiber optic intubation for airway protection. He
was initially on AC which was weaned to PSV 5/5 and he was
successfully extubated on [**2181-6-14**] and comfortable on room air
prior to discharge to floor. In terms of his fever/facial
swelling, the differential included mumps, adeno, paraflu,
parotid duct obstruction, bacterial parotitis, or facial
cellulitis. Angioedema also possible given hx of lisinopril
(most likely cause), aspirin, and ibuprofen use, combined with
eosinophilia.  His neck CT findings were not consistent with
enlarged parotid glands or severe facial cellulits; hence
angioedema seemed most likely. His lisinopril and ASA were
stopped because of their penchant (especially lisinopril) for
causing angioedema. ENT was also consulted and did not find any
obvious sources for his neck swelling. Steroids were held
because of concern for infectious etiology (though 1 dose was
given; ENT had felt that holding the steroids for use until
prior to extubation would be a better strategy).
Viral throat cx negative, strep throat cx negative. After his
initial neck CT, he had a repeat neck CT on [**6-12**] which showed new
stranding in the subcutaneous soft tissues of the posterior neck
and occiput consistent with edema. THere was also stranding of
soft tissues of the chest, slight stranding near the parotid
glands is stable, irregularity of opacification of the left
internal jugular vein (probably due to filling artefact as this
appears to occur near the entry point of an anterior venous
structure), and iterval opacification of the paranasal sinuses
with increasing mucosal thickening. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 100410**] of these
findings, as diagnosis still remained uncertain. The filling
defect was not a thrombus as confirmed by US.
He was initially on steroids, but stopped per ENT as it was felt
that the effects of the steroids would be most useful to
decrease airway edema prior to extubation.
Allergy was consulted who felt that patient should not be
continued on lisinopril, but K to restart ASA and dipyridamole.
Per dental consult, tooth pathology likely not cause of pt's
neck swelling. With Diphenhydramine alone, the patient's edema
had started to resolve and his oxygenation and ventilation were
appropriate four days after intubate; hence he was extubated
without difficulty. On discharge C1 esterase inhibitor, Mumps
antibody and C2 was still pending.
.
# Hypotension: no clear etiology of the pt's hypotension during
the initial episode of neck swelling was found. The pt was
thought to be hypovolemic and he was thought to have increased
intrathoracic pressures due to airway obstruction from the
swelling. These two factors were thought to decrease the pt's
diastolic filling on which he was largly dependent given his
outflow obstruction in the context of HCOM. The pt was treated
with Nafcillin, Levo and Flagyl for five days, but antibtiotics
were subsequently discontinued as the pt was afebrile and all
cultures were negative and no clear source of infection was
found. THe pt remained afebrile for four days after
discontinuation of the antibiotics.
.
# Hypoxia: Pt's O2 requirement was felt to likely related to
airway compromise from severe facial/neck swelling. He underwent
fiber optic intubation for airway protection. He was initially
on AC which was weaned to PSV 5/5 and he was successfully
extubated on [**2181-6-14**] and comfortable on room air prior to
discharge to floor. On CXR, he was found to have a slightly
widened mediastinum; a chest CT ruled out dissection. Of note,
his CXR was also consistent with pulm edema, likely secondary to
aggressive IVF, but did not impair his oxygenation.
.
# Abdominal pain: no evidence of intrabdominal pathology on CT.
POssible in the context of angioedema. Resolved.
.
# Anemia: Pt hematocrit was trending down in the setting of
acute disease. Guaiac negative. No other source of bleeding.
Folate and Vit B12 normal. Iron studies consistent with anemia
of chronic disease. The pt's hct stabilized with improvement of
clinical status, although his reticulocyte count was not
adequate. The pt was not on any medications other then Depakote
that could explain his anemia, especially no marrow suppressive
medications. Further work up should be performed as an
outpatient if the pt persists to be anemic. F/u hct recommended
within one week.
.
# Seizures: Continued depakote.  THe pt missed a few doses while
he was intubated which explains his transiently low valproic
acid level. Levels were rising as Depakote was restarted at home
dose. F/u level in one week is recommended to ensure adequate
levels.
.
# Rash: The pt developed a mild diffuse rash thought to be
secondary to antibiotics which was given when he was hypotensive
to treat for sepsis emperically.  His rash improved after
withdrawing the antibiotics.
.
# Low back pain-chronic s/p laminectomy. Pt on oxycontin at
home, held in the context of hypotension. Not restarted upon
discharge as the pt was pain free.
