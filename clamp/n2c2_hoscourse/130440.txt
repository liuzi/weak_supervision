In the ED, he was initially hypotensive (70s/40s) and
bradycardic (50s). He was treated as a beta-blocker overdose and
given IVF (~2L NS) and glucagon, with improvement in his
hemodynamics. He had a CXR, CTA and CT torso, all of which were
unrevealing.
.
He recieved empiric broad spectrum antibiotics (metronidazole
500 mg IV, levofloxacin 750 mg IV and vancomycin 1 g IV) and was
transferred to the medical floor. On the floor, he developed
rigors, fevers to 104.1 with tachycardia to the 110s and
hypoxemia to 88% on RA. There was no witnessed aspiration event,
although the pt does have a h/o aspiration for which he was
treated at an OSH.  He received a dose of diazepam for possible
EtOH withdrawal that had no immediate effect. Of note, the pt
did receive a pneumococcal vaccination on the day prior to
admission.
.
On transfer to the ICU, the pt reported feeling well. He denied
shortness of breath, and reported that the arm pain that he
presented with had gotten better. He denies lightheadedness,
neck stiffness, cough, sputum production, diarrhea, abdominal
pain, dysuria.
.
ICU COURSE;
Fever hypotension/Shock: Given the pt's history of aspiration,
considered aspiration pneumonitis. Although he did not have a
witnessed aspiration event, his wife reports a nearly identical
admission ~2 years ago. Also in the differential were pulmonary
embolism, an intrabdominal source of infection with associated
sepsis, a reaction to the pneumococcal vaccine-which
chronologically fits well with the story/cytokine like effect,
neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome. PE is
unlikely given his normal CTA. An intrabdominal infection is
unlikely given his normal CT scan and abdominal exam. A reaction
to the pneumococcal vaccine is the most likely factor at this
point as there is no signs of infection/endocrine phenomenon.
His CK is not elevated, and he is not rigid on exam, making NMS
unlikely. He is, if anything, hyporeflexive, making serotonin
syndrome unlikely.  As his hypotension was accompanied by
bradycardia it is felt likely that an etiology could be beta
blocker overdose (not felt to be intentional).
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim was negative, no growth from his cultres at 48
hours.  TSH was normal.  An EKG showed 1st degree AVB.  He was
given IV fluids, stress dose steroids, vanco/levo/flagyl for
broad empiric coverage and pan cultured.
A CXR on [**7-8**] showed ?LLL infitlrate vs atelectasis.  Diuresis
with 10mg IV lasix was performed and a PA and LAT were done
after diuresis that showed a retrocardiac density, no overload
but clinical suspicion of pneumonia was low.
An echo did not show any vegetations.
Pneumovax was added to his allergy list.
.
#hypoxemia-Pt had 02 req of 2-3L prior to transfer. He did not
have symptoms such as cough/SOB/wheeze. Pt was given aggressive
hydration on admission for hypotension. Resultant CXR showed
this as well as crackles on exam.  He autodiuresed once his BP
had improved and his CXR showed improvement in hilar edema.
However  there was question of LLL infiltrate on CXR [**7-8**] and
persistent 3L NC O2 requirement.  Vanco was discontinued and
levo/flagyl was continued until diuresis and repeat PA and LAT
to assess LLL, CXR showed a left retrocardiac density (pna vs
atelectasis)-however he no longer had an oxygen requirement even
with ambulation.  He will follow up with his PCP.
.
#Incontinence-Pt had two episodes of fecal incontinence on the
day of discharge, pt reports this is a chronic occurence which
happens when he is not at home.  He denies back pain, rectal
exam was with normal tone, no saddle anesthesia, no paraspinal
tenderness.  Pt given prescription for bedside commode.  He was
instructed to seek medical attention if any symptoms of leg
weakness, saddle anesthesia, back pain developed or if the
incontinence continued at home.

.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: He had runs of irregular SVT
on telemetry.  He was continued on flecainide.  His metoprolol
was held due to bradycardia.
An echo showed LVEF 70%, mild AS
.
# Bipolar disorder: antipsychotics/SSRI restarted.
.
# FEN/Lytes: Regular diet, replete lytes prn
.
# Prophylaxis: For DVT prophylaxis he was given Heparin SC 5000
tid, pneumoboots, bowel reg.
