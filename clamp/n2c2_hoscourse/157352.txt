MICU Course
62M Crohn's dz presented with worsening dyspnea, orthopnea and
lower extremity edema as well as diarrhea and weight loss.
.
# Dyspnea/PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] presented with dyspnea with mild cough,
orthopnea and lower extremity edema and had oxygen saturations
in the low 90s on a 60% venturi mask. Chest imaging did not show
any focal process but was concerning for either fluid overload
or an inflammatory process. A BNP was ~200. He was initially
diuresed for suspected CHF exacerbation and started on
levo/flagyl (later ceftriaxone, azithromycin, flagyl) for
possible pneumonia. He failed to improve on diuretics and
antibiotics. An echo showed no evidence of significant systolic
dysfunction (EF 50%). On the second day of hospitalization
sputem cultures showed PCP and he was started on IV bactrim and
IV steroids. His oxygen requirement significantly improved over
the next two days and he had oxygen saturations ~95% on 3L NC at
the time of transfer to the floor. On medicine floor, pt
continued to improved; O2 sat requirement decreased and was able
to take POs. Pt discharged to rehab to complete course of abx
(PO bactrim DS 3 tabs TID, 21 days [**Date range (1) 88033**] per ID) and
recovery.
.
# HIV/AIDS: Diagnosed this admission with HIV viral load of
489,000, CD4 of 10 and OI as above. ID consult was obtained for
management of PCP in [**Name Initial (PRE) **] newly diagnosed HIV patient and it was
agreed to continue with IV bactrim and steroids (3wk course,
switched to PO prednisone on [**2188-12-21**] at 40mg x5days the 20mg
prednisone x11days). HAART therapy was not initiated at this
time in the setting of acute PCP infection and concern for
immune reconstitution. Arrangements were made for outpatient
follow up with ID (see discharge plan information). Details of
acquisition not discussed in detail but per patient he thinks
likely within past 6 months. Please note that his family and HCP
(his superior) do not know; at this point, pt is not ready to
tell them. As pt was able to tolerate POs, both meds and food,
and began having more normal BMs, pt was transitioned to PO
bactrim per ID to complete his course of abx.
.
# Acute Pancreatitis: Likely drug-induced, possibly from lasix
initially given with concern for CHF. Initially asymptomatic,
found by chest CT which peripancreatic fluid tracking into left
pararenal space. Lipase was noted to be elevated at 1446 and
amylase at 455. RUQ ultrasound showed fatty infiltration of
liver but otherwise no biliary ductal dilatation and no
peripancreatic fluid collection. Treated with bowel rest and
IVF. Lipase rapidly resolved. Pt was then able to advance diet
and take POs.
.
# Crohn's: dx in [**Location (un) 7349**] by colonoscopy ~9 months prior to
admission. Previously treated with Asacol but stopped due to
poor toleration. On bunetinide oral steroids at time of
admission in addition to PO cipro and flagyl which was started
~3 months prior to admission for bloody diarrhea with good
results (these were all stopped and NOT restarted at discharge).
Evaluated by GI in house and felt appropriate for outpatient
follow up. However, given HIV status, ID was concerned that a
diagnosis of Crohn's so late in life was unusually and felt that
another OI may be the cause given pt's CD4 was 10. CMV and LGV
were both negative. ID and PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] scheduled, will arrange
GI follow-up as other issues are address and concern for other
OI ruled out.
.
Pt was full code during admission.
Pt was transferred to rehab facility to complete his recover. He
will follow-up with ID; pt will arrange GI follow-up at a later
date as an outpt.
