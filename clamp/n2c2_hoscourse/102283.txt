ASSESSMENT:
74 year old male with BPH, s/p R inguinal hernia repair present
with pleuritic abdominal/chest pain found to have a extensive
lymphadenopathy throughout torso and aotocaval large
conglomerate mass with compression of IVC and R common iliac
vein.
.
# Lymphoma- Patient was initially admitted to the medical floor
for expedited evaluation of presumed lymhoproliferative disorder
in the setting of CTA which showed bulky lymphadenopathy and
aortocaval large conglomerate mass with
compression of IVC and right common iliac vein. Initial labs in
the ED were remarkable for lactic acidosis with HCO3 of 15 and a
lactate of 7.9. On the medical floor, he was found to have a
uric acid of 13.5 and an LDH of 604 in the setting of normal
calcium/ phosphate/ potassium. He was started on allopurinol and
IVF due to concern for TLS. A heme-onc consult was called and an
axillary LN biopsy showed prelimary path c/w aggressive
lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy eventually showed diffuse large B
cell lymphoma. Patient was noted to have increased work of
breathing with ABG showing worsening acidosis 7.32/19/111 and
lactate of 11.4. A bicarb drip was initiated and due to concern
for worsening lactic acidosis, patient was transferred to the
ICU. Lactic acidosis was attributed to tumor mass necrosis vs.
infection and patient was started on vanc/zosyn/azithro for
pneumonia visualized on CT chest (see below). He received [**Hospital1 **]
for treatment of his lymphoma and tumor lysis labs were
monitored q6 given his spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome on
admission. He received rasburicase for persistently elevated
uric acid and new renal failure (creatinine 1.3 from 1.0) with
improvement of his symptoms. He became fluid overloaded and was
diuresed with lasix. He was called out to the floor where he
received a round of RCHOP with good effect and no subsequent
tumor lysis. He had some mucositis which was managed with pain
medications and mouth care. He was discharged home on D5 RCHOP
with follow up scheduled in the 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] outpatient clinic and
a plan to establish care in NY with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25139**]
(appointment tentatively scheduled for [**12-24**]).

# Pneumonia- Patient had chest CT with ground-glass parenchymal
opacity, suggestive of pneumonia. He was started on
vanco/zosyn/azithro and was continued on these antibiotics for 7
days after he was no longer neutropenic per pulmonary
recommendations. Repeat imaging with CT scan showed widespread
peripheral consolidations concerning for an inflammatory
etiology such as eosinophilic pneumonia or organizing pneumonia,
but ultimately attributed to resolving pneumonia in the setting
of a reconstituted immune system as the patient was asymptomatic
and appeared well. Patient will need repeat imaging in [**12-22**] weeks
after discharge to assess progression.
.
# Rash- Patient developed an erythematous papular eruption on
his back as well as a well demarcated erythematous plaque on his
lower L back. Dermatology was consult and attributed the former
to a resolving drug reaction and that latter to a contact
dermatitis. Triamcinolone was applied topically to the plaque
with gradual improvement.
.
#. Fluid retention: Patient received fluids as part of his
chemotherapy regimen. His weight increased 10 lbs over several
days secondary to fluid retention. He was diuresed with good
effect and subsequently reaccumulated fluid in his legs with the
second round of chemo. He was restarted on lasix and sent home
to continue diuresis with f/u in the outpatient clinic.
.
#. Headache: Patient complained of mild intermittent R
retro-orbital pain without associated visual changes, diploplia,
or floaters. Was seen by opthalmology who attributed his eye
symptoms to dry eyes. CT head w/ and w/o contrast was negative
for bleeds and metastatic disease.
.
# Shingles- Patient complained of continued post herpetic
neuralgia related to his shingles episode six months earlier.
His pain was managed with lidocaine patches and
oxycodone/oxycontin.
.
#. BPH: No active issues. Patient was continued on finasteride
and tamsulosin as his home BPH medications were not on
formulary.
