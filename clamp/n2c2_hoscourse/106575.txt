  The patient underwent T10 to L4 anterior
spinal fusion, partial vertebrectomy of L1, L2 and L3 and
anterior allograft placement at L4-L5 with autograft on the
day of admission [**2195-4-27**].  The surgery was done by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 363**].  Post surgery the patient was followed by the acute
pain service and was managed on Dilaudid PCA.  The patient
was also followed by [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center physicians for
management of her brittle diabetes.  The patient had been on
an insulin pump prior to the operation.
Postoperatively, the insulin pump was discontinued and the
patient was placed on an insulin drip.  The plan was to restart
the insulin pump when the patient was ready for self management.

During her first surgery the patient had a chest tube placed.
In the posterior procedure, she had
fusion of T10 to L5, with multiple thoracic and lumbar
laminotomies, and segmental instrumentation application from T10
to L5 with autograft, osteotomy of L2 and L3, and had an epidural
catheter placed.  The description of the procedure may be
found in the operative notes.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the Trauma
CICU.  She continued to be intubated and sedated.
Postoperative day two the patient was intubated but alert.
The patient was extubated on [**2195-5-4**] and continued to
be on a face mask.  The patient was on tube feeds and
monitored by nutritional services.  Pain was controlled with
Dilaudid drip.  The patient was managed on the PCA for pain
control with Dilaudid .  The pain control was monotored by
the acute pain
service.  The Hemovac drain was removed on postoperative day six.
The following day the Foley catheter was discontinued and the
patient was transferred to the medical surgical floor from
the Trauma CICU.  Bilateral pneumoboots were continued for
prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis.

The patient was intermittently after the second surgery and
medical consult was requested.  The confusion was attributed to
the effect of analgesia, Dilaudid, which was discontinued on
[**2195-5-9**].  The patient's mental status slowly improved.
Along with improvement the patient brought her concern
regarding visual loss.  Both ophthalmology and
neuro-ophthalmology consults were requested.  The patient was
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10030**] from neurology who found no evidence of
cortical blindness but an ischemic optic neuropathy. MRI with
angiography of the head and neck was obtained
and finally a brain scan was obtained.  It showed mild
symmetric decreased perfusion to the primary and secondary
visual cortex.  The patient was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 915**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2523**] from
Neuro-ophthalmology.  His impression was the patient had
bilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy with
hallucinations.  Recommended to follow up with him in six to
eight weeks.  His phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 49741**].  Also needs
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ophthalmology in [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes
Center.

The patient continued to be mobilized by physical therapy
daily.  She was able to ambulate with TLSO brace with
assistance supervision 75 feet.  On day before discharge the
patient was screened and accepted by rehabilitation center on
[**Hospital3 **].  She will be discharged today [**2195-5-15**].
