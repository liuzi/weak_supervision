77 year old female with h/o COPD on 2L nc, hypercarbic resp
failure, HTN, pulmonary nodules who was found to be unresponsive
at her nursing home, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory
distress, found to be hypothermic in ED, hyperNa, and w/
fluctuating BPs.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory distress: Patient with COPD on 2L home
O2, w/ elevated bicarb from nursing home a week ago and likely
CO2 retainer.  Her pH suggests compensated process and elevated
bicarb suggest that her respiratory status likely has
deteriorated over a chronic period of time due to worsening
COPD.  Although CXR was not notable for PNA, CTA showed some
suggestion of retrocardiac opacities and sputum w/ Gram positive
cocci on gram stain.  PE was ruled out w/ CTA.  Patient was
treated for HCAP (vancomycin, levofloxacin and cefepime), along
with standing nebulizers.  There was difficulty controlling her
anxiety with recurrent hyperventilation on pressure support.
Initial extubation attempt on [**2-20**] failed due to tachypnea, low
minute ventilation and eventually hypercarbic respiratory
failure.  Patient was continued on HCAP coverage and started on
steroids for COPD exacerbation and marked bronchospasm on
examination.  TTE showed a moderate pericardial effusion w/o
signs of tamponade with diastolic dysfunction.  Patient
underwent IV diuresis.

A major barrier to her extubation was felt to be anxiety leading
to tachypnea, in addition to above factors.  She was tried on
multiple sedative and antipsychotics and best regiment was felt
to be clonazepam 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] (prior attempted medications w/o
significant improvement - xanax, ativan, zydis, seroquel).

Per [**Hospital1 2177**] records, baseline ABG was confirmed to be
7.33-37/70-80/39/80-100.

Patient was extubated on [**2-26**]. She tolerated this well, however
was noted to be very sensitive to hyperoxia (as during nebulizer
treatments or increased supplemental oxygen) with resultant
hypercarbia, resp. distress (requiring return to ICU though no
intubation).  This improved w/ reduction of supplemental O2. She
was restarted on antibiotics with vancomycin, levofloxacin,
cefepime though there was no CXR evidence of recurrent
pneumonia.  She was narrowed to levofloxacin and remained
afebrile and stable.  Her goal O2 sat should be 88-92 to prevent
resultant hypercarbia and acidosis.  Patient's Advair dosing was
increased to 500/50 and tiotropium was restarted w/ albuterol
inhalers.  Nebulizers were discontinued seondary to hyperoxia as
above.  Patient was stable on 1.5L NC at the time of discharge,
sat'ing 88-96%.  Patient will continue levofloxacin through
[**2169-3-10**] for total 8 days treatment.

# Altered mental status: Patient recieved number of sedating
medications per nursing home records, which in addition to
hypercarbia could have contributed to her mental status changes.
 Patient w/ leukocytosis and hypothermia on admission, though
infectious w/o negative.  Labs also notable for hyperNa, and
appeared volume depleted by exam.  CTA head/neck unremarkable,
and neuro exam in non-focal.  Seizure seemed unlikely given the
above factors.  No meningeal signs on exam.  Urine and blood
cultures were negative; sputum culture positive as above. Sodium
was corrected.  Much of this was felt to be due to transient
hypercarbia and benzodiazapines.  At time of discharge, patient
was alert and oriented x 3.  She was tolerated clonazepam 0.5mg
qAM and qHS.

# Bacterial pneumonia: Hypothermic in ED 92.5 and patient w/
leukocytosis.  Lactate mildly elevated.  Hypotensive in the ED,
but normotensive in ICU.  See above for further discussion.
Patient completed vancomycin and zosyn course for HCAP. On
return to the ICU, concern for RLL pneumonia, so patient was
restarted on antibiotics, vancomycin and levofloxacin.  Patient
was narrowed to levofloxacin and is now day [**5-12**], should be dosed
through [**2169-3-10**].

# COPD with exacerbation: Discontinued nebulizers secondary to
respiratory distress in setting of hyperoxia. Albuterol inhaler
as needed and daily tioptrium restarted per home regimen.
Patient is on a long steroid taper, currently 30mg po daily,
with plan to decrease weekly by 10mg (next decrease Saturday
[**2169-3-12**]).

# Pericardial effusion:  Noted on prior OSH records.  TTE here
showed moderate effusion that seemed unchanged on repeat TTE.

# HTN: Blood pressure controlled with home amlodipine and
addition of lisinopril 2.5mg po daily.

# Transitional issues:
- discontinue levofloxacin after [**2169-3-10**] (8 day course started
[**3-3**])
- goal O2 sat 88-92% (patient has been reaching this goal with
1.5L NC)
- avoid nebulizers as high flow oxygen has worsened respiratory
distress, patient is stable on albuterol inhalers and tiotropium
- patient was full code throughout admission; several family
meetings confirmed her wishes for cardiopulmonary resuscitation
if necessary
