Mr. [**Known lastname 7842**] was emergently brought to the operating room where
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed replacement of his ascending aorta and
subtotal arch along with aortic valve replacement. For surgical
details, please see seperate dictated operative note. Following
the operation, he was brought to the CVICU in critical
condition. Initially coagulopathic, he required multiple blood
products. Postoperative TEE was notable worsening pericardial
effusion with questionable signs of early tamponade. He
concomitantly had a slight decline in renal function. Renal
ultrasound showed no evidence of aortic dissection into the
renal arteries. On postoperative day two, he returned to the
operating room for re-exploration. Given prolonged period of
sedation and intubation, tube feedings were started for
nutritional support. As sedation was weaned he became extremely
agitated with question of nonpurposeful movements. Head CT scan
and MRI were obtained which did not show any large area of
territory infarct. Neurology service was consulted and
attributed his altered mental status to most likely
toxic-metablolic encephalopathy. He remained hypertensive and
continued to require Labetolol drip for adequate blood pressure
control. He also experienced postop fevers, and pan-cultures
were obtained. He was empirically started on antibiotics for
possible ventilator associated pneumonia along with positive
blood cultures. Over several days, clinical improvements were
noted. He was eventually extubated on postoperative day nine. He
was transferred to the step down floor.  He was seen in
consultation by the physical therapy service.  He was gently
diuresed.  A PICC line was placed and he was screened for rehab.
 By post-operative day 15 he was ready for discharge to rehab.
