37 year old female with past medical history of FSH producing
macroadenoma s/p TSS x 2 complicated by panhypopituitarism for
which she is on chronic prednisone and levothyroxine admitted
with hypotension, hypoglycemia, hypothermia and bradycardia
likely due to adrenal crisis.

1. Adrenal crisis: Unsure of the precipitant. Could be medical
noncompliance with past history even though patient and her
sister report compliance.  It could also be precipitated by
viral upper respiratory tract infection.  She was started on IV
hydrocortisone in the MICU and transitioned to prednisone 20 mg
po qdaily on discharge with help of endocrinology.

She was empirically started on Vancomcyin/Zosyn to cover for
bacterial infection precipitating adrenal crisis but they were
discontinued on day 3 as blood cultures were negative x 48 hours
and no source of infection noted on imaging and exam.  TTE, EKG
and cardiac enzymes did not reveal any cardiac pathology.

2. Hypernatremia: Likely due to central diabetes insipidus.
Sodium returned to [**Location 213**] with DDAVP admission and urine output
returend to  less than 200 cc/hr.  She was discharged on
scheduled 0.1 mg of DDAVP at bedtime.  She was also instructed
to drink to thirst.

3. Panhypoptituitarism s/p TSS x 2 for pituitary macroadenoma.
Continued on home levothyroxine 75 mcg po qdaily.
Glucocorticoid replacement as above.  Currently not on any
estrogen replacement which she could benefit from to prevent
osteoporosis.

4. Prolong QTc: Likely due to sinus bradycardia in setting of
electrolyte imbalance. She does not report chest pain.

5. FSH pituitary adenoma.  Follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21721**] in 1
week after discharge.  Defer to primary endocrinologist
regarding imaging to determine there are any signs of growth of
her adenoma

6. Abnormal affect: Per baseline per patient's sister. Unsure of
psychological component. Patient reports not being depressed or
having ahedonia. CT head showed age advanced atrophy.  She
refused to speak with social worker.

7. Anemia: Iron studies showing anemia of chronic disease with
concaminant iron deficiency anemia. S/p one unit of PRBC in
MICU.  She was started on iron sulfate 325 mg po qdaily with
retic count of 1.1 on discharge.

8. Hyperglycemia: Likely due to increased steroids. Was treated
with sliding scale insulin

Follow up for PCP/endocrinology
1. Taper steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21721**]
2. Please consider estrogen replacement to help prevent
osteoporosis
3. Please consider MRI head to determine whether her diabetes
insipidus is related to growth in her macroadenoma.
4. Please check retic count 2 weeks after discharge ([**2107-7-15**])
to determine whether she has a response to iron sulfate
