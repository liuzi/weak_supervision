MICU COURSE:
82 year-old Spanish speaking female with a history of CAD s/p
recent BMS to RCA, type II DM, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation admitted with hypothermia and
hyponatremia.

# Hypothermia:
# Hypoglycemia:

# Hyponatremia:

# CAD: Recent BMS to RCA, pt was continued on home ASA, plavix,
statin.

# Hypertension: Antihypertensives initially held.  She was
restarted on her BB and [**Last Name (un) **] at lower doses.  They should be
titrated up as needed.

# Atrial fibrillation: Currently in NSR, on coumadin for
anticoagulation.  Lovenox held (had been on lovenox bridge to
coumadin from prior hospitalization) given extensive bruising on
her abdomen.  Coumadin titrated up to 5 mg at time of transfer.


# Mass Along Bladder: On her CT scan from ED, she was noted to
have a mass on the posterior aspect of her bladder concerning
for malignancy.  She had a urine cytology sent which is
currently pending and should have urology follow up for possible
cystoscopy.

# Left toe laceration: Secondary to fall, per preliminary
report, cannot rule out extension into bone. As her hypothermia
has resolved and there is little suscipicion of infection and
her exam benign, further imaging deferred.

82 spanish speaking F with afib, CAD s/p recent BMS to RCA, dm2,
admitted with fall, hyponatremia, hypothermia, hypoglycemia.
Pt initially presnted with hypothermia, bradycardia and
hyponatremia, concerning for hypothyroidism.  TSH however was
wnl.  Sepsis unlikely given pt hemodynamic stable and no clear
source for infection (symptom of dysuria in setting of foley
catheter, clean u/a), adrenal insufficiency also unlikely. Given
negative work up and occurence with hypoglycemia, hypothermic
episode most likely [**2-23**] her hypoglycemic episode.  She received
external warming and her temperature normalized on the first day
of her hospital stay.  Blood and urine cultures remained
negative throughout her ICU stay.

.
1. Fall/ C5-6 retrolisthesis:
Fall sounds mechanical in nature. CT showed C5-6 retrolisthesis.
c-spine was cleared by Neurosurgery in ED. Neuro exam remains
non-focal
- PT consult
- no events on tele except bradycardia - approx 50
.
# Hypothermia:
This resolved with simple warming measures, was likely [**2-23**]
hypoglycemia. There was initial concern for possible sepsis,
though bld cx and urine cx are NGTD. TSH wnl.
.
# Hypoglycemia/Type II Diabetes, controlled with complications:

Hypoglycemia was in setting of poor PO and continued long acting
insulin, now resolved.  Also, it was found that pt's husband
administer's patient's insulin, but does not have a clear method
for calculating dose of insulin, and it appears that pt does not
even check her glucose daily or even weekly.  Nursing spent
significant time educating patient, husband and daughter about
the need for frequent daily glucose monitoring, and the use of a
sliding scale.  Patient was discharged on NPH and sliding scale,
as used during the hospitalization.
Recommend that patient have geriatrics consult with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 713**]
after discharge.

.
# Hyponatremia:
Pt noted to have hypovolemic hyponatremia on admission,
corrected with hydration.  She was encouraged to increase her PO
intake.
 Sodium runs baseline in 130s likely [**2-23**] diuretics.
.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure, EF 50%:
currently euvolemic
- patient returned to her home dosing of cardiac medications
prior to discharge.
.

# Mass Along Bladder: On her CT scan from ED, she was noted to
have a mass on the posterior aspect of her bladder concerning
for malignancy.  She had a urine cytology sent which is
currently pending and should have urology follow up for possible
cystoscopy.
**Please follow up**
.
# CAD:
Recent BMS to RCA. No active CP symptoms, trop 0.07, though
baseline mildly elevated, ECG with LBBB
- Cont home ASA, plavix, statin, BB
.
# Chronic renal failure, Stage III:
cr 1.3 at baseline
- Cr currently at baseline
.
# Atrial fibrillation:
now in SR
- c/w coumadin, INR 1.9 at discharge
- c/w metoprolol
.
# Anemia:
hct 26.3, baseline around 30, has remained stable since
admission.
- request outpatient follow-up
.
# Left toe laceration:
Secondary to fall.
- Xray toe without fracture
.
# FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet
.

# F/u: recommend outpatient Geriatrics consult with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 713**]
