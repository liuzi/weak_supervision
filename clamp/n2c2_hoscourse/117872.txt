Mr. [**Known lastname 71166**] was admitted on [**2154-2-26**] after routine duplex scanning
of his legs revealed right superficial and peroneal vein DVT and
left posterior tibial DVTs.  Due to his recent occipital strokes
a CT scan was obtained prior to the administration of heparin.
The CT scan showed bilateral occipital lobe hypodensities, right
larger than left, unchanged from prior studies.  Neurology was
consulted and a heparin gtt was started at a low rate.  A few
hours after the heparin was started he began to complain of new
visual hallucinations that he did not have before.  Due to
concerns for hemorrhagic conversion of his prior CVA he was
transferred to the ICU for monitoring and a head CT was obtained
that showed areas of subacute infarction in the occipital lobes
bilaterally, unchanged since [**2154-2-26**] with evolving hemorrhage
within the infarctions.  His heparin gtt was immediately stopped
and 2 more follow up head CTs showed no change.  An EEG was
obtained and this show signs of encephalopathy but no seizure
activity.  His hallucinations continued and Keppra [**Hospital1 **] was
started.  A 24hour EEG was obtained, an initial interpretation
showed no seizure activity, but the final read is still pending
as of his discharge.  He was transferred back to the floor.  His
diet was advanced and he is having bowel function.  His
labarotory work is stable.  His visual hallucinations are vastly
improving and his main complaints are blurry vision in his left
visual fields.  He is discharged on Keppra with transplant as
well as neurology follow up.  A Cardiology consult was obtained
to evaluate for closure of his ASD as an appropriate date.  His
tacro dose was decreased to 1.5mg [**Hospital1 **] based on his level.  His
prednisone was decreased to 15mg daily.
