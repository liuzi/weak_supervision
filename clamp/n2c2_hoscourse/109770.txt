In brief, Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] was a 47 year old lady with a diagnosis of
HTLV-1 associated Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma who initially
presented with hyerpcalcemia.  Her hospital course was
complicated by Mental Status changes which after ICE therapy
necessitating an admission to the ICU without any acute evidence
of an intracranial process. Her hospital course at this time was
also complicated by persistent ATLL, hypercalcemia, renal
tubular acidosis, acute renal failure, C. Diff colitis, and CMV
viremia.  Subsequently she developed hypoxic respiratory failure
secondary to invasive aspergillosis with pulmonary hemorrhage.
She underwent a pulmonary embolization procedure and a second
intubation and ICU stay.  Upon returning to the floor, no
additional therapeutic intervention was started for her ATLL.
Her mental status continued to deteroirate, and she stopped
taking PO.  Due to disease progression in addition to a
persistent fungal infection and concern for aspiration goals of
care were discussed with her family.  Due to her poor prognosis,
she was made DNR/DNI, and subsequently CMO.  She passed
peacefully on [**2103-9-23**].
