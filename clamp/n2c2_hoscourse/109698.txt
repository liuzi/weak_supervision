[**Hospital 153**] Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] is an 83 yo F with PMH atrial fibrillation, s/p left
hip replacement admitted to the MICU for respiratory depression
s/p getting morphine for pain and agitation in the PACU.
.
#Respiratory depression: was most likely [**3-11**] morphine given
postoperatively in the setting of baseline renal insufficiency.
On arrival to the ICU she is maintaining her respiratory rate
and ABG with normal CO2.  CXR showed no edema, pleural
effusions, vascular congestion.
.
#Hypotension: she has borderline hypotension on arrival to the
ICU (recent bp in clinic 90/60), likely 2/2 blood loss in the
OR, volume depletion and afib with rvr.
Pt received 2U PRBC for post op anemia and then another 2U the
day after for a drop in Hct. Hypotension resolved following
appropriate volume resuscitation.
.
#Afib wit RVR: likely [**3-11**] operative stress/medication, new
anemia. Pt was monitored on the tele. Pt was relateively
rate-controlled on Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg PO QID.
Pt placed on lovenox for anticoagulation and bridged to
Coumadin.  Patient therapeutic at the time of discharge.  TTE
was unremarkable.  She needs to be on propanolol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] per
[**Female First Name (un) 1634**] Med not metoprolol when she goes to rehab.
.
#s/p left hip replacement: was doing well post op. On Tylenol,
Lidocaine patch, and low dose oxycodone for pain control. xrays
showed good component position.
.
#agitation: was given Haldol PRN, standing seroquel. Geriatrics
service was consulted who raised the consideration that she also
might be suffering from mild etoh withdrawal.  This cold also
explain her tachycardia.  She was therefore started on low dose
ativan.
.
#chest pain: brief, fleeting. No EKGs changes. troponins flat.
