Mr. [**Known lastname 4587**] is a 74 yo M with h/o strokes resultant in minimal
responsiveness, aphagia, frequent aspiration, who presented from
[**Hospital3 **] with tachypnea and question of seizure-like
activity.

# ?Aspiration Pneumonia:
Patient presented with tachypnea, fever, tachycardia, elevated
WBC and was admitted to the MICU. He was started empirically on
Vancomycin and Zosyn for aspiration pneumonia.  Chest CT-A ruled
out PE, as he was not on any DVT prophylaxis at the nursing
facility.  Chest CT also showed bibasilar atelectasis vs
consolidation. Patient was transitioned to azithromycin and
transferred to floor when hemodynamically stable.  On the floor,
he was restarted on Vancomycin and Zosyn for concern of
aspiration pneumonia, re-evaluating bibasilar consolidations on
Chest CT, likely secondary to chronic aspiration from tube
feeds.  Pt was discharged bac kto the facility to continue IV
antibiotics for a total of 7 days.  Pt was without fevers or
leukocytosis at the time of discharge.

# History of Seizures:
Patient was reported to have had seizure-like activity prior to
presentation. Corrected Dilantin level was within therapeutic
range. Pt was continued on seizure ppx, and had no clinically
evident seizure activity. A 48 hr EEG was performed which showed
no seizure activity, only epileptic interictal discharges,
consistent with past stroke.

# Diabetes Mellitus:
Patient was continued on home insulin regimen.

# Hypertension:
Patient was continued on BB, Hydralazine and Lisinopril.

# Anemia: Is normocytic, likely secondary to chronic disease.
Hct was stable, a fecal occult blood was ordered.
.
# Patient was DNR/DNI during this hospitalization.  Pt has a
left PICC for IV access. Pt was maintained on SC Heparin for DVT
ppx. Pt was on tube feeds for nutrition.
