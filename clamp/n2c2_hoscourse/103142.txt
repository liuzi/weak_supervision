Floor course 1:
Pt was initially admitted to the floor service for further care
of a COPD exacerbation. On the evening of admission ([**10-21**]), pt
had an episode of [**7-9**] left sided CP with concurrent SOB that
improved with SL NTG. Pt's troponin and CK were subsequently
positive (0.13 and 162) and EKG had lateral ST depressions so he
was started on a heparin drip. A cardiology consult was obtained
on [**10-21**] and further medical management was initially presued.
On the evening of HD #1, the pt developed acutely worsening SOB
with tachypnia to the 40s. ABG showed 7.24/57/222 so he was
transferred to the MICU for management of hypercarbic
respiratory failure including noninvasive ventilation.
.
MICU course:
In the MICU, pt's respiratory status improved with noninvasive
ventilation, continuous nebs, IV steroids, and lasix. Anxiety
related SOB was also been an issue for which pt received
klonipin. Pt continued to be followed by cardiology for his
NSTEMI and had a peak troponin of 0.21 at 10:46 PM on [**10-21**].
Echo was done on [**10-22**] showing a LVEF of 40 to 45% with severe
AS. Pt continued to have severe respiratory distress requiring
continuous BIPAP and persistent troponin elevation thought to
bue due to secondary demand ischemia. A cardiac cath was not
obtained as it would have required intubation which the pt did
not desire. TPN was started for nutritional support on [**10-24**]. Pt
was weaned off of noninvasive ventilation on the evening of
[**10-26**] and has been having an oxygen sat of 100% on 6L NC. He was
also started on an insulin drip on [**10-26**] secondary to
persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Insulin drip was
weaned off prior to being transferred to the floor for further
care; pt was continued on NPH and insulin sliding scale.
.
Floor course 2:
.
1. Respiratory- On the floor, pt continued to have good O2
saturations ranging from 97-100% on 1-2Lnc. Pt was continued to
be aggressively treated for COPD with standing and prn albuterol
nebs, atrovent nebs, montelukast, azithromycin, and steroid
taper. Pt was seen by pulmonary consult. From their
recommendations, we discontinued atrovent and started spiriva.
We also switched from azithromycin to bactrim. Azithromycin has
anti-inflammatory properties, but there is still little good
evidence for its benefit in COPD. Pulmonary felt that Bactrim
would be a better antibiotic, in the the setting of long-term
steroids since it has PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 21150**]. Advair was added the the
regimen. Prednisone taper was continued. The taper is to be as
follows: Prednisone 50 x 7 days, 40mg x 7 days, 30mg x 7days,
then continue with 20mg. Klonipin which was given for anxiety
was discontinued secondary to lethargy. Pt will follow-up with
outpatient pulmonologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known firstname **].
.
2. CAD/[**Name (NI) 102410**] Pt had a NSTEMI on [**10-21**] which was felt to be
most probably due to demand but acute coronary syndrome could
not be absolutely excluded. He was on heparin for 5 days and was
d/c'ed in setting of left subconjunctival hemorrhage. Since pt
is just recovering from his COPD exacerbation, we felt that it
would be safer to defer cardiac cath as an outpatient. Pt agreed
with this plan and stated his wish not to be cath'ed during this
admission. Cardiology was okay with this plan and they plan to
re-evaluate him in 4 weeks. In the meantime, pt was continued on
with medical management. He was continued on diltiazem for rate
control (beta blocker not used in order to avoid it's
bronchospastic effects). However, diltiazem was unable to be
titrated up secondary to blood pressure intolerance; pt's HR
remained in 90-110 range. Pt was continued on captopril, but
most doses were held secondary to blood pressure intolerance.
For now, we will discontinue ACEi; please add it back on as
tolerated. Pt was continued on aspirin and statin.
.
3. Severe aortic stenosis- Pt found to have severe aortic
stenosis on echo during this admission. The plan to be have
cardiac cath as an outpatient after pulmonary rehab for a formal
assessment of the aortic valve. We avoided beta blocker and
nitoglycerin.
.
4. Steroid induced diabetes mellitus- Pt was continued on NPH
and sliding scale. Oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**] glipizide was added. Pt is on
Metformin as an outpatient, but we did not restart that since pt
may be at increased risk for lactic acidosis in the setting of
hypoxia or cardiac ischemia. Please continue to titrate up
glipizide and adjust NPH as indicated.
.
5. [**Name (NI) 12329**] Pt had a difficult time tolerating diltiazem and ACEi
given his low blood pressures ranging from 90-100 systolic. We
will continue diltiazem for rate control and hold ACEi for now.
Please titrate up dilt for better rate control. If BP tolerates,
can consider restarting ACEi
.
6. Subconjunctival hemorrhage- Occurred in setting of IV heparin
and noninvasive positive pressure. There was slow resolution of
the hemorrhage. Pt was continued on erythromycin ointment qid.
Ophtho stated that it may take 2 weeks for the hemorrhage to
resolve. After then, pt should be safe for elective cardiac
cath. Should anti-coagulation be urgently indicated prior to
resolution of hemorrhage, ophtho feels the hemorrhage should not
be an absolute contraindication. Pt will f/u with [**Hospital **] clinic
one week after discharge.
.
7. [**Name (NI) 14983**] Pt was continued on PPI.
.

8. Crohn's disease- Stable Pt was continued on mesalamine DR.
.
9. FEN- Was on TPN in MICU which was discontinued. Pt was
continued on cardiac, [**Doctor First Name **] diet.
.
10. Proph- SC heparin; PPI; bowel regimen.
.
11. Access- PICC line ([**10-22**])
.
12. Code- DNR/DNI.
