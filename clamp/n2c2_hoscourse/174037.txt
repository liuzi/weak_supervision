# Acute severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis: Lipase was elevated to
4788 at the OSH. OSH CT showed pancreatitis and concern for
pancreatic necrosis. EtOH pancreatitis is the most likely
etiology. She underwent MRCP at our hospital which demonstrated
hemorrhagic, necrotic pancreatitis. Patient was managed
conservatively with aggressive fluid replacement. A surgery
consult was obtained and did not advise any operative or IR
procedures for the peripancreatic inflammation. She subsequently
developed acute lung injury, bilat pleural effusions,
anasarca,and ascites as a result of the severe pancreatitis. Her
course was complicated by vent associated pneumonia as well. She
also showed altered mental status during her ICU stay related to
toxic and metabolic encephalopathy. Patient required insulin
replacement therapy while she was in the unit and on the floor.
She was then transferred from the ICU to the floor. There, she
had PT/OT, blood transfusion for anemia from hemorrhagic
pancreatitis, and diuresis. Before transfer to rehab she was
noted to have significant and had CXR. This showed possible
loculated left upper lobe effusion. She underwent repeat CT of
the chest on [**2164-11-2**] which showed moderate bilateral pleural
effusions and anterior loculated left pleural effusion.  Case
was discussed with interventional pulmonary service and given
the patient's improving clinical status and lack of active
evidence of infection, they recommended not performing a
paracentesis to evaluate the loculated effusion.  The patient
was educated to return if she develops fevers, rigors, sweats,
worsening difficulty breathing.
.
# Altered mental status: Her mental status was altered and
related to toxic and metabolic encephalopathy. Head imaging was
negative (CT and MRI)including EEG. She is back to normal mental
functioning after her prolonged and complicated course.
.
# VAP: Sputum grew MSSA (imipenem sensitive). She was initially
on Vancomycin and imipenem. Vancomycin d/ced ([**Date range (1) 82010**]). She
was transition ed from Imipenem ([**10-16**] ?????? [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin on
[**10-22**], but Imipenem was restarted again given decompensating
respiratory status. CT chest on [**10-26**] was concerning for
worsening multifocal pneumonia, so her antibiotics were changed
from Imipenem to Vanco/Zosyn. Microbiology data has been
negative since [**10-17**]. 14 day course of antibiotics were completed
on [**10-30**]. Cough improved with expectorant and mucous clearing
device. Before transfer to rehab she was noted to have
significant and had CXR. This showed possible loculated left
upper lobe effusion. She underwent repeat CT of the chest on
[**2164-11-2**] which showed left anterior loculated effusion.
.
# Pulmonary edema/Acute lung injury:  Extubated [**10-21**] but
emergently re-intubated [**10-23**] during event with SVT and
hypotension. Patient was extubated again [**10-25**]. CT chest showed
interstitial changes and pleural effusions. Bronchoscopy on [**10-17**]
was WNL, and samples significant only for 2+ polys and staph
aureus. She continued to receive to Lasix with effective
diuresis.
.
# SVT: Patient has prior h/o of Afib. Reportedly never
anticoagulated. Episodes of SVT appear to be precipitated by
diuresis. She was emergently re intubated on [**10-23**] during episode
of SVT with hypotension that did not respond to electrical
cardioversion. Patient was loaded on amiodarone and remained in
NSR thereafter. CTA was negative for PE. She was then placed on
maintenance dose of 200 mg /day. Patient was also continued on
home dose of metoprolol.
.
# Horase voice: patient had traumatic intubation and continues
to have a hoarse voice. ENT reports vocal cords functional and
will continue to take time to recover.
Plan for pt to f/u with ENT in 2 wks after discharge.
.
# RLL nodule ?????? RLL nodule appreciated on Chest CT. This will
require outpatient follow up in 10 - 30 days after discharge.
PCP was notified on [**2164-11-2**].
.
# Nasal skin necrosis possibly related to her ICU stay. She was
seen by plastic surgery on [**2164-11-2**]. The necrosis is not
infected. They recommended local care and out patient follow up
at their resident clinic.
