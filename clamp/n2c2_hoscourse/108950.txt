Patient expired.

69 yo F with metastatic breast cancer prsents with vomitting,
poor po intake and dyspnea and to be in acute renal failure with
hyponatremia.  Was tachycardic and complaining of mild chest
tightness.  Admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and
hyponatremia, then to the oncology floor.  See below for
discussion of each issue.
.
Goals of care: meeting in ICU regarding goals of care and poor
prognosis, then reiterated on the oncology medicine floor:
Code: DNR/I (discussed with patient and HCP), and daughter HCP
[**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 80568**]. Focus on comfort with symptom management.
Avoidance of invasive procedures, per family (son, daughter,
sister).
[**Name2 (NI) **] died the morning after being transferred to the ICU.
.
# Altered mental status: Patient does not respond to verbal or
visual stimuli on the floor. Likely d/t progressive metastatic
disease, combined with renal failure, hypotension, pain, SBP
infection, delirium. Pain controlled with IV morphine prn,
treated SBP with ceftriaxone, palliative care following.
.
# Chest Pain: unclear etiology, seemed to be costrochondritis
related as the pain was reproducible. Ruled out for MI with
three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  A V/Q of her chest was
ordered to rule out PE, but the patient was unable to lie flat
and complete the exam so it was aborted. Held anticoagulation
d/t goals of care, no CTA given ARF, could not tolerate V/Q
scan. On the floor, patient unable to verbalize whether chest
pain still present. Pain medications provided.
.
# Hypotenion/Tachycardia: likely was related to underlying
cancer and hypovolemia.  Was volume resuccitated with NS and the
LR while in the ICU for the first two days.  She was offerred a
CVL in the ED and declined.  Her BP improved to SBPs in the 90s,
then 100s with IVFs and remained stable.  Initially she seemed
fluid responsive with a decrease in rate from 130s to 110s
(which seemed to be her baseline).  She remained tachycardic on
day two of admission without an obvious cause as she seemed
mostly fluid repleted.  We continued to bolus her and pursued a
further workup for PE.  Initially she had negative LENIs and a
CT was deferred because of ARF.  A V/Q scan was performed on
[**2179-3-10**], but she was unable to lie flat for the test and the
test could not be completed.  She was bolused periodically
overnight to maintain MAP of over 65.  Her tachycardia improved
with IVF boluses prn.
.
# Hyponatremia/Acute renal failure: Based on exam and history,
likely hypovolemic hyponatremia. Most likely Gi losses combined
with third spacing in the setting of ascites. With fluid
resuccitation, she corrected and normalized very quickly but did
not have any neurological changes.  She did have a CT head in
the ED that showed no intracranial lesions to explain this.  Her
ARF also improved with IVFs and her urine output remained brisk
throughout her hospitalization.
.
# Thrush: Likely due to poor po intake and nausea/vomitting.
Started swish and swallow for her comfort.
.
# Breast Cancer: mid-cycle in her avastin and navelbine.  Is
metastatic and has recurrent ascites requiring taps.  On
presentation, her abdomen was soft and a therapeutic
paracentesis was deferred because of her hypovolemia, moderate
hypotension and neutropenia.  Oncology was consulted and
followed along.  Patient to oncology floor, outpatient oncology
attending described poor prognosis. Family meeting regarding
poor prognosis and goals of care; patient not to have further
chemotherapy or interventions/invasive procedures.
.
# Leukopenia: Likely chemo related, as last dose was [**3-1**]. ANC
600 so not yet neutropenic and never needed to be on neutropenic
precautions. On 3 18, her WBC began to recover.
.
# Pleurex catheter placed to help with paracentesis/ascites
drainage. SBP treated with ceftriaxone.
