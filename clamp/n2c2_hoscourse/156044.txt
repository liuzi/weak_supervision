Her Urine Sodium was 48, her serum Osm was 248 and her Urine Osm

off by the  Neurology sevice and transitioned over to keppra for
antiseizure prophylaxis. Also, her HCTZ was discontinued and her

improved to 134 by the morning of [**2141-10-26**].  The pt. remained
stable while in the ICU, showing no evidence of seizure
activity, and her mental status gradually improving.  Per
request of the Neurology service she underwent an [**Date Range **] that on
