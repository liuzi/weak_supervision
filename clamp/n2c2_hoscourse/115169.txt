#Hypotension/Sepsis: On admission, patient met SIRS criteria
with fever, tachypnea, tachycardia and lactate of 2.5 consistent
with sepsis. Infectious source was likely biliary tract vs. HD
line infection, however also considered was pulmonary source w/
new O2 requirements although more likely from capillary
leak/CHF. Patient has remained fluid responsive intially without
need for pressors. The underlying infection was treated with IV
vancomycin/unasyn/gentamycin for synergy until cultures at OSH
grew enterobacter at which point only zosyn was continued with
appropriate coverage. The patients lactate level, fevers and WBC
were trended and returned to [**Location 213**]. Zosyn was switched to
Ciprofloxacin after the patient developed a drug rash.
.
#Mechanical ventilation: Patient came to the ICU intubated s/p
ERCP, on a propofol drip. Initially he was hypotensive which was
treated with IV fluids and discontinued propofol, switching to
fentanyl/versed for sedation.  Shortly thereafter the patient
became restless, agitated and continued to be hypotensive. He
was given 10mg vecuronium and paralyzed for arterial line
placement and foley placement. His labile blood pressures also
exacerbated his already fluid-overloaded state, making it
difficult to wean off the vent. The initiation of hemodialysis
effectively controlled his BP and fluid status, and on day 7,
after his second ERCP, he was extubated and started on CPAP
overnight.
.
# Gallstone Pancreatitis: On admission the patient had elevated
LFTs, pancreatic enzymes, bilirubin and alk phos. His levels
slowly trended down post-ERCP except bilirubin and AP, which
continued to rise. The patient experienced intermittent
epigastric discomfort which prompted a RUQ US, which showed a
fatty liver but the common bile duct non-well visualised. CT
scan of abdomen showed no intrahepatic biliary dilatation,
cholelithiasis, and a subtle hypodensity in pancreatic head.
Hepatology and ERCP were consulted prompting a second-look ERCP,
which showed sludge drainage in the major papilla, stent
migrated to major papilla and several stones in the cystic duct.
The stent was replaced, antibiotics were continued, and the
patient's enzymes and bilirubin were trended.
.
# ESRD: Initially the nephrology service felt HD was not
appropriate early during admission, in setting of patient
becoming hypertensive to 200s with volume resusitation for
pancreatitis. Beta-blockers were started however the patient did
not respond and O2 sats started trending down with worsening
acidemia and low PaO2. The following day HD was initiated with
good response in blood pressure. The patient received HD
throughout his course, with the day before D/c the final time.
.
# Hypoxia: Suspected capillary leak in the setting of sepsis vs.
CHF as pt with known CAD. The patient was weaned off his O2
requirement prior to discharge.
.
# Drug Rash: Patient developed a diffuse petticheal/macular rash
on his chest and legs which was pruritic.  Dermatology was
consulted who felt consistent with a drug rash.  Offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
was felt to be Zosyn.  [**Doctor Last Name **] was discontinued and rash improved.
He will continue hydoxyzine, sarna and fluocinonide.
.
# CAD: An echo was performed to rule out endocarditis as a cause
of fever. This showed extensive calcification of cardiac
skeleton, mild calcific aortic stenosis, and no definite
vegetations . His ECG had some ischemic changes of unclear
duration, and the patient had no active symptoms. Cardiac
enzymes were stably elevated on admission and, in the setting of
ESRD, this was unlikely to be acute event. His aspirin and
plavix were continued and the patient remained on telemetry for
the duration of his stay.
.
# OSA: Witnessed apneic episodes while asleep. Known history of
OSA on CPAP as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
Once patient was extubated he was started on CPAP overnight.
.
# Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW. Unclear baseline. [**Month (only) 116**] be
low related to ESRD (not on epo as outpatient that we know of).
D. bili not consistent with hemolysis. Hematocrit was trended
and continued to improve with HD and management. Renal recs: use
epo during HD.
