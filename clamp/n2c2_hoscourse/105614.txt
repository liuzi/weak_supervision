.
# Infected pacemaker - He was seen for this complaint in [**Hospital **]
clinic on [**2113-6-7**]. He denies any fevers or chills but has been
experiencing pain at the pacemaker site with his usual activity.
His WBC was 5.1 with a normal differential on [**2113-6-12**], and he was
admitted on [**6-15**] for lead and device extraction. On arrival to
the CCU, the patient was hypotensive with SBP in the 60s. He
received a 200cc NS IVF bolus with improvement to the 90s. He
complained of left-sided chest pain as well as pain and tingling
in his fingers bilaterally, left worse than right. There is no
weakness or numbness of the hands. The pains are intermittent.
ECG showed V-pacing at 60 bpm. STAT TTE showed no obvious
effusion or depressed ventricular function, CXR was also
unremarkable. His external pacemaker rate was increased from 60
to 80 bpm. He was started on IV Linezolid. He did not require
any further IVF or vasopressor support.  The patient underwent
pacer and lead extraction on [**2113-6-15**] without complication. A
temporary pacer was also placed after removal.  The patient
remained stable and blood cx were NGTD.  He was seen by ID who
recommended 2 weeks of linezolid from pacer extraction [**2113-6-15**].
The patient had a new pacemaker placed on [**2113-6-19**] without
complication.  CXR showed no PTX and leads in proper position.
His wound culture eventually grew coag-neg staph.  The patient
will have both ID and EP follow-up with weekly labs.   The
patient remained afebrile and pacemaker was working properly.

# complete heart block (rhythm) - See above for management of
pacemaker. The patient had his lead and pacer extracted on

without complication.

# coronaries - The patient has no known CAD or findings of CAD
on ECG.  He remained chest pain free. He was continued on home
ASA.

# pump - The patient had an intra-op EF 35-40% with moderate
global LV hypokinesis. He remained clinically euvolemic.

# hypertension - The patient's anti-hypertensives were intially
held secondary to his hypotension.  Once his pressures had
stabilzed he was restarted on lisinopril 10mg and home
metoprolol succinate 12.5mg at the time of discharge.
