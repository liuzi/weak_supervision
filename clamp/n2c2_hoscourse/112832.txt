Mrs. [**Known lastname 104299**] was underwent a CT scan in the ED for c/o abdominal
pain. Her CT scan revealed a small bowel obstruction near her
known ventral hernia which was reducible at the beside. General
surgery was consulted, and she was admitted to the ICU found to
have junctional brady rhythm with prolonged QT (QTc near 600) in
context of recent increase in Flecainide dose per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was
monitored in the ICU for a few days. Cardiology was consulted,
and recommended holding beta blocker, and flecanide. Coumadin
was also held in case of need for surgical intervention. In
addition, her Potassium of 2.9 and Magnesium were aggressively
repleted. Her cardiac status stabilized after undergoing
diuresis with Diamox, however, her abdominal exam worsened over
the following 48 hours after a few days of conservative
management with NPO/NGT for decompression and IV antibiotics.
.
She was taken to the OR, and underwent lysis of adhesions and
small bowel resection.
Her operative course was uncomplicated, routinely observed in
the PACU, and transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where cardiac monitoring
and electrolyte correction occurred. She was transfused post/op
with 2 U PRBC. HCTs remained stable thereafter. She was
extubated and wean off pressors, and transferred to Stone 5.
.
Physical therapy was consulted upon transfer to Stone 5 for
expected discharge to REHAB due to physical deconditioning.
Remained NPO until bowel function resumed. Electrolytes checked
and repleted daily. Hyponatremia resolved gradually. Started on
sips of water, advanced to clear liquids. Noted to have
difficulty swallowing and clearing secretions. Bedside Swallow
study conducted. She was taken for Video swallow, and cleared
for regular diet with thick liquids, and whole pills in puree.

throughout post-op recovery.  Foley was removed. She was able to
urinate, incontinent of urine. UA and urine cultures negative.
.
Mobility compromised. She requires [**1-26**] people for ambulation and
transfer. Requires aggressive physical Rehab, and monitoring of
Nutritional, bowel, and cardiac status. She should follow-up
with PCP (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2450**]), and cardiology to address cardiac
events (prolonged QT interval) during this admission. [**Hospital 197**]
clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] manages the patients coumadin dosing for PAF.
Coumadin 2mg Po given at [**2140-4-4**]. INR should be checked on
[**2140-4-5**], and daily until therapeutic. Goal INR [**1-26**].
