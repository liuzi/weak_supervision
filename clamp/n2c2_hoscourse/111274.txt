55 year old male had prolonged hospital course complicated by
multiple infections, mental status changes, and renal failure
who requires long term antibiotic therapy.

# Sepsis/Meningitis:  He was transferred from [**Location (un) **] in the
setting of high-grade MSSA bacterimia and mental status changes,
and intubated on arrival because of question seizures and
concern for airway protection.  Before speciation returned, he
was initially managed with vancomycin and zosyn, and then
switched to nafcillin given MSSA.  He also required pressors
intermittently on the day after presenting but this was
ultimately thought to represent a low-baseline blood pressure,
and pressors were subsequently discontinued, with MAPs that
remained greater than 65.  The source of his infection was
unclear but thought to be secondary to left foot ulcers, which
also grew MSSA.  This was evaluated by podiatry and vascular,
and he was found to have osteomyelitis of the first toe, and
would possibly need L BKA for definitive treatment. There was
also concern for encephalopathy given his worsening mental
status prior to and after transfer, and neurology was consulted.
 An LP was initially deferred because of the unlikelihood of him
developing meningitis during his hospitalization at [**Location (un) **], as
he did not initially present with symptoms suggestive of this
condition.  However, it was later performed and was consistent
with bacterial meningitis, and antibiotics were changed to
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir.  ACV and CTX were then
discontinued as CSF culture returned negative and other cultures
continued to be MSSA.  He was extubated after 10 days and
tolerate this well.  Vancomycin was continued following transfer
to floor.  A thorough work up for source of infection, including
LP and left foot imaging, did not yield a source.  As patient
continued to improve clinically, the decision was made to treat
empirically with vancomycin until [**6-5**], dosing during HD.

# Altered mental status: After extubation, patient was
delirious, not responding to commands, and with jerking motions
of his head.  An MRI/MRV was negative for structural abnormality
on [**2165-4-25**], after EEG showed possible alpha-coma waves.  His
mental status cleared after 4 days extubation suggesting ICU
narcosis.  He began to follow commands on [**2165-5-4**].  Following
transfer to floor, fentanyl patch was discontinued in favor of
morphine PO.  The patient's mental status continued to improve
without further intervention.  At time of discharge, patient was
oriented to time, person, and place.

# ? hypodense region in TT2 area of spinal cord:  Intial concern
was for abscess with cord compression as patient was febrile
with MSSA infection and not moving his lower extremities for
several days pre-extubation [**2165-4-30**].  Neurosurgery was consulted
and recommended CT myelogram or MRI to better define this
lesion.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (radiology) stated CT myelogram was not
indicated and suggested MRI.  Mr. [**Known lastname 77642**] was unable to fit in
the MRI scanner far enough to scan his spine so he was watched
clinically and improved. Consider f/u MRI in open MRI scanner as
an outpatient.

# Respiratory failure:  He was intubated shortly after ariving
at [**Hospital1 18**] because of concern for airway protection in the setting
of question seizures, as he had low-amplitude clonic movements
of his hands and legs. His vent settings were weaned and plan
for extubation on [**5-1**] was moved up after he bit through the
tubing to inflate the cuff.  He was extubated after 9 days and
his respiratory status continue to improve.  EEG obtained showed
no epileptiform activity.  Patient had stable respiratory for
the duration of his hospitalization following extubation.

# Acute Renal Failure: His creatinine began rising prior to
transfer from a baseline of 1.3, and he developed oliguric renal
failure.  Renal was consulted and their analysis of his urine
was consistent with ATN secondary to sepsis, though there was no
clear documentation of hypotension from the OSH.  He had to be
started on HD ([**2165-4-26**]) for volume overload and hyperkalemia. At
that point his creatinine was 9.8. He continued on HD and
eventually a temporary dialysis catheter was placed (on [**5-2**])and
the femoral HD catheter was pulled. His urine output improved,
although his need for HD continued.  The patient had another
dialysis catheter placed on [**5-15**] for HD, with subsequent
self-removal secondary to agitation.  A tunnelled catheter HD
line was placed on [**2165-5-17**] for resumption of HD.  The patient
continued receiving HD 3 times weekly on the floor, and pt's
creatinine was 2.2 at time of discharge.  The patient will
continue HD following discharge and will be followed by the
nephrology service.

# Hypertension: After septic picture resolved, patient was
hypertensive to 200s/80s.  His losartan was held for renal
protection in hopes that his renal function would recover.  He
was started on metoprolol and hydralizine with better control.
Pt's HTN was managed well on the floor following ICU transfer
with the current medication regimen at discharge.

# L foot ulcer: Likely seeding to blood causing sepsis. ESR and
CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment for
osteomyelitis.
- Podiatry and vascular surgery were consulted and stated they
would defer amputation and await stabilization/abx treatment of
patient prior to surgery.
- no intervention was pursued, as patient improved clinically on
floor on vancomycin
- pt will have ID follow up on [**6-5**]

# Right hip OA: significant source of pain and had required
large doses of narcotics prior to admission.  Per family, the
plan was to replace his hip, but he was battling recurrent
infections from L toe delaying this.  Morphine PO with scheduled
tylenol proved an effective regimen for his pain.

# Large bowel obstruction:  A KUB demonstrated a distended
transverse colon concerning for ileus in the setting of large
narcotic use for R hip pain.  General surgery was consulted and
felt that it was improving and did not require surgical
intervention. He eventually began stooling again after PO narcan
was started and with an aggressive bowel regimen.  Following
transfer to floor, constipation resolved with bowel regimen and
change in opiate use.

# CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH and was continued on
ASA/plavix.  He was not on a beta blocker or statin at home for
unclear reasons.

# DM:  Managed initially with an insulin drip because of
elevated finger sticks and converted to a sliding scale.  [**Last Name (un) **]
consulted and placed patient on a basal bolus regimen with good
control at time of discharge.  This regimen will be continued at
rehab.

# Renal Cell Carcinoma: Is seen at [**Hospital1 2025**].  Per family, he was
recently diagnosed ~2 cm mass, CT torso without mets.  He was
scheduled for cryoablation prior to this hospitalization.

# Gout:  Renally-dosed Allopurinol and then d/c'd given renal
failure.

# Communication: [**Name (NI) **] wife, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 77643**] - cell

# Patient was made DNR, but okay to re-intubate for respiratory
failure post-extubation.
