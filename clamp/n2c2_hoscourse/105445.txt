The patient was admitted to trauma service on 09//[**4-9**] after a
fall at home.
She has a history of chronic atrial  fibrillation treated with
Coumadin. Upon admission her  INR was 6.0. CT scans from
[**Hospital 1474**] hospital as well as our institution showed a large left
retroperitoneal hematoma and a contrast study showing acute
extravasation. The patient had been generally hemodynamically
stable but has required pressors and several units of packed red
blood cells after admission. She underwent embolization on the
[**2105-9-5**] after arteriography showed a acute contrast
extravasation consistent with bleeding from the left L5 lumbar
artery. This branch was successfully Gelfoam embolized. Her
lateral compression pelvic fracture was complicated by bleeding
but did not require surgical orthopedic management for
stability. Mrs [**Known lastname 24397**] is encouraged to weight bearing as
tolerated and when able with a walker. Orthopedics  will follow
her course and see her as an outpatient 4 weeks after discharge.

We diuresed her with several doses of IV furosemide. Her
breathing and clinical
exam greatly improved. The patient was not able to ambulate in
the hospital yet, but remained stable.
During her hospital stay she was  not anticoagulated with
coumadin, given her recent episode of bleeding. She is receiving
5000 units sq heparin twice daily and is instructed to get in
touch with her PCP as soon as possible to resume her coumadin
therapy. We increased her beta-blocker dose to 50 mg QID.
Her most current hematocrit is 27.9%.
