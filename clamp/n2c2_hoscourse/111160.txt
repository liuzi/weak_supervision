#. Severe, necrotizing gallstone pancreatitis: Resolved. Most
likely gallstone pancreatitis though LFT pattern not c/w
prolonged obstruction. Imaging at outside hospital demonstrated
the presence of stones in addition to common bile duct
dilitation. She was initially treated with meropenem  which was
discontinued after several days. Surgery and ERCP services were
consulted and suggested supportive medical management of
pancreatitis. ERCP was deferred during acute disease state given
that no obstructing stones were identified on CT and RUQ U/S.
After acute disease state resolves, she will require lap
cholecystectomy or ERCP with sphincterotomy (in 2-3months).

#. Hypoxemic/hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Resolved. Initial
episode of respiratory failure was thought to be due to ARDS, as
well as bilateral effusions and some vascular congestion,
suggesting volume overload in the setting of aggressive volume
resuscitation. After pt's pancreatitis started to improve, she
was aggressively diuresed and weaned off of sedation and the
ventilator. She did not have a cuff [**Last Name (LF) 3564**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was given
steroids for 24hrs and was ultimately extubated.

After extubation, pt was called out to general medical floor on
[**6-23**]. Within 24hrs, she developed worsening mental status and
increased work of breathing. She was found to be hypercarbic on
ABG. Despite aggressive diuresis and a trial of bipap, pt's CO2
did not improve, so she was re-intubated in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. After
intubation, a bronchoscopy was performed that did not reveal any
evidence of lobar infiltrate consistent with aspiration or pna.
BAL cx was negative. A CTA was performed that revealed relative
[**Name (NI) 20534**] of [**Name (NI) **] consistent with ischemic changes, but no
thrombus was identified. LENIs were performed and did not
demonstrate any evidence of clot and echo did not show right
heart strain. She was also noted to have persistent bilateral
pleural effusions. Due to the fact that no definitive clot was
found and she clinically improved, a decision was made to not
anticoagulate. She was extubated on [**2141-6-28**], and approximately
15min after, she developed stridor and increased wob. She was
treated with steroids, racemic epinephrine and heliox for
presumed laryngeal edema. After several hours her respiratory
status improved and within 24 hrs she was weaned to nasal
cannula. Chest X-ray showed improvement in bilateral effusion
despite persistent ataelectasis. On discharge she was
comfortable at rest and with ambulation on room air.

#. Ventilator associated pneumonia: On [**2141-6-20**], she developed
worsening fevers and increased sputum production. Other sources
of infection were investigated (normal U/A, abdomen imaging
unchanged, no diarrhea), so she was empirically treated for VAP
with vancomycin, zosyn and ciprofloxicin. Pt completed a 8 day
treatment course for VAP. No current evidence of infectious
process

#. Acute renal failure: Thought to be AIN after being exposed to
cipro and zosyn, both of which can cause AIN. Renal U/S was
performed and did not reveal any signs of hydronephrosis. Pt's
cr continued to improve (last 1.2) and she continued to have
good urine output.

#. Tachycardia: Improved with treatment of acute disease and
with restarting her home verapamil and metoprolol (PCP confirmed
that both are for hypertension).

#. Insomnia/delerium: Was previously on olanzapine for steroid
vs. ICU induced delerium. She responded well however complained
of increased insomnia. Olanzapine was discontinued and Trazodone
was ordered.

#. Diabetes: She has had fluctuating blood sugars. Initial
hyperglycemia treated with SSI and lantus resulted in next day
hypoglycemia. Resolution of hypoglycemia achieved with D5W and
holding insulin. Hyperglycemic again on [**2141-7-2**] with glucose in
400s. She was continued on gentle HISS while NPO. She was
ultimately transition back to glargine and HISS. The diabetes
service saw the patient and also adjusted her insulin dosing.

#. Hypertension, benign: Held home amlodpine, lisinopril and
verapamil initially on admission. She was restarted on verapamil
and metoprolol.

#. Peripheral Vascular Disease:
- Continue home dose of ASA

# Anemia: Hct on admission in the 40's, now 23. Improved from
yesterday. Iron studies c/w anemia of CD with ferritin of 859.
Normocytic. LDH is elevated, but bili is normal and coags are
normal so hemolysis and DIC seem less likely causes.
-consider transfusion if hct <21

# Leukocytosis, thrombocytosis: Peaked on [**6-30**]. UA negative.
Afebrile. Suspect that this may have been related to aspiration
as her WBC and platelets are now improving.
