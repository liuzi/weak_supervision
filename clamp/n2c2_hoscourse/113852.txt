79yo male admitted to ICU for probable angioedema due to
lisinopril injestion.

1. Angioedema
Pt was admitted to the ICU and was intubated and sedated.  He
was also started on IV steroids, H2 blockers, and benadryl.  ENT
saw patient and recommended keeping 6 mm tube in place.
However, patient self-extubated overnight and actually remained
stable.  His condition improved and he was transferred to the
floor for further care on [**2164-8-26**].  He was initially on 4L NC
and satting in high 90s and this was quickly weaned.  He
experienced some soreness of the throat and had a difficult time
swallowing pills at first.  ENT saw him and thought this was due
to trauma from the ET tube and not lingering angioedema.  As his
angioedema improved he was able to tollerate first thick
liquids, then a regular diet.  He was switched to PO steroids
with a 7 day taper starting on [**8-27**].
