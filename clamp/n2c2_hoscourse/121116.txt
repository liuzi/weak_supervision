54 y/o f with massive GI Blead and bradycardic arrest in ED,
with evidence of active bleeding at gastric and duodenal ulcers.
 Patient's admission comprised of 2 day MICU stay with continued
hemodynamic stability, followed by several days on the medicine
[**Hospital1 **] for monitoring, physical therapy, treatment for hypoxia and
neurologic evaluation.

1. Upper GI Bleed: PUD likely [**3-7**] NSAIDs.  Pt was continued on
PPI, initially IV and transitioned to oral.  Her hematocrit was
monitored twice daily initially, and then daily.  All NSAIDS and
Actonel were held, with a recommendation to continue to avoid
these medications after discharge.  Gastrin level was elevated,
but believed secondary to PPI therapy.  Pt will require
outpatient GI follow-up.  Finally, concern regarding the level
of insight underlying the patient's large doses of NSAIDs,
coupled with her family's concerns about her psychiatric
history, prompted psychiatric and neurologic evaluations.  Both
of these services followed the patient through her admission.

2) Question of cholescystitis:
RUQ U/S for ? sludge and GB wall thickening on CT. U/S
equivocal. HIDA scan negative. [**Doctor First Name **] consulted but ascertained
that there were no further surgical needs.  Cultures and
hepatitis serologies were unrevealing, and exam and LFTs
normalized.  Increased LFTs were likely [**3-7**] hypotension on
presentation.

3) Elevated LFTS: DDx includes cholecytitis, effect of
hypotension, muscle damage.  Likely dignosis was hypotension on
presentation given negative work-up delineated above.  Held
Lipitor given transaminitis for outpatient review.

4) Bradycardia: possibly due to massive GI Bleed, or elev K and
acidosis, resolved in ICU

5) Metabolic acidosis:
-likely lactic acidosis from hypotention and hypovolemic shock,
although lactate mildly elevated (but checked after
resucitation), aspirin negative, resolved in ICU.

6) Leukocytosis: some evidence of PNA on CT with 4+ GPCs on GS,
also ? gallbladder wall edema on CT.  Evidence lacking for
cholecytitis, MICU team hypothesis was that elevation [**3-7**]
demargination under stress.  Continue to monitor, f/u cultures,
d/w PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was on vanco/unasyn in the ICU, narrowed to
levofloxacin as she had suggestion of pneumonia but no other
infection.

7) Wheezing/SOB: Patient with likely COPD as she has smoked [**3-8**]
PPD x over 30 years.  The patient improved with nebulizer
treatments, and will be discharged on bronchodilators with
outpatient follow-up.

8) Neuro/Pyschiatric: Patient on Fluoxetine, clonazepam and
Anafranil at home, which were originally held in the ICU.
Psychiatry consult was called after discussion with the
patient's sister, who was concerned about her inability to work
and general lack of ability to care for herself, most clearly
manifested financially.  The psychiartry consult had no
medication recommendations, and her TSH/B12/Folate/RPR were all
negative or within normal limits as appropriate.  They suspected
a cognitive problem and were concerned by her lack of judgement
however, and also recommended an MRI.  The read of this MRI was
notable for multiple T2 high-signal-intensity abnormalities in
the periventricular white matter and centrum semiovale.  The
findings suggested a demyelinating disorder, or potentially a
microvascular angiopathy.  There was also an area of abnormality
in the left periatrial white matter, which could represent one
of these demyelinating areas or could represent a small subacute
infarct.

The neurology team recommended an LP for routine analysis,
oligoclonal bands, and ACE level to evaluate for multiple
sclerosis and sarcoidosis; [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, CRP, and ESR levels to
evaluate for vasculitis; formal neuropsych evaluation as an
outpatient and follow-up in behavioral neurology clinic.  The LP
was performed prior to discharge, and the bulk of the serologic
testing was performed.  The patient's PCP will [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] these
studies as an outpatient.  In addition, the psychiatry team
tried to get in touch with her PCP and psychiatrist as an
outpatient, but had been thusfar unsucessful at the time of
discharge.

9) FEN: Patient was tolerating a normal house diet at the time
of discharge.

10) follow-up: A follow-up appointment was arranged for the
patient with her PCP before discharge.  She was also given
instructions for neurology, behavioral neurology, psychiatry and
neuropsychiatric testing follow-up.  Finally, she was
recommended to have her hematocrit checked the week following
discahrge to ensure continued stability.
