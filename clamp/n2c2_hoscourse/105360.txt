NSTEMI:  Patient reported chest pain in setting of shortness of
breath, which appeared to be multifactorial. Denied any chest
pain but does endorsed shortness of breath which improved.
Complete cardiac biomarker set unavailable from outside records,
but appears had NSTEMI given biomarker elevation, EKG changes,
and decreased EF resulting in acute heart failure (60's to 30's
EF).  Nuclera stress at OSH showed large area of ischemia
extending from anterior wall and anterior apex of inferior wall
with evidence of prior small lateral wall infarction. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of cardiac catherization,
but first required aspirin desensitization as has documented
aspirin allergy.  Left cardiac ICU after aspirin
desensitization.  Cardiac catherization confirmed triple vessel
disease with RCA occlusion and LAD 80% occlusion.  Patient was
informed of necessity of coronary artery bypass, and declined
surgical intervention multiple times.  Based on patient wishes,
optimized medical management and defered surgical treatment.
* Medical management with Atorvastatin 80 mg qhs, Carvedilol
6.25 mg PO BID, ASA 325 mg PO qday, Captopril 12.5 mg TID.
* [**Month (only) 116**] want to switch short acting captopril to longer acting
lisinopril as an outpatient.

Acute systolic heart failure (last EF 35 %):
Patient developed acute systolic heart failure given EF decline
from 60 % ([**2108-3-6**]) to 35 %.  Most likely from ischemic event
as above. His dry weight in unknown, and he has experienced
weight loss in the past 3 months of about 20 lbs. At the OSH,
had flash pulmonary edema and an oxygen requirement which
resolved in house. Discharge weight steady at 140 lbs and
physical exam suggested euvolemia.
* Continued medical management with Captopril 12.5 mg PO TID,
Carvedilol 6.25 mg PO BID.  [**Month (only) 116**] want to change short acting
captopril to longer acting lisinopril as an outpatient.
* Deferred use of spironolactone as borderline hyperkalemia at
4.7.

Bilateral pulmonary embolisms, recurrent s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter
placement:  He has had second episode of pulmonary embolism in
past year. Uncertain as primary imaging report not available to
classify as segmental, subsegmental but overall did not appear
to cause hemodynamic instability at presentation. Etiology
unknown.  Given advanced age, 20-lb weight loss, and chronic
tobacco abuse, would suspect that neoplasm high on differential.
Other etiologies like immobility or recent surgery not present
to explain recurrence, and no family history of thrombosis.  Had
heparin gtt in house.  Discharged with 10 days worth of
enoxaparin injections with bridging therapy with coumadin to
treat PE.
* Follow up CBC/ Coag panel
* Discuss with patient duration of anticoagulation (life long?)
* Confirm age appropriate cancer screening on outpatient basis
per above
* consider thrombophilia work-up as outpatient
* IVC filter in place
