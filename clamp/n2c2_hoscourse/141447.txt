this medication and felt better.  He was on nitro gtt in the
CSRU and was urinating when his syncope occurred there.  On xfr

symptomatic originally, but asx after a fluid bolus of 1L.  The
following day he was symptom free.  The leading dx for his

flomax/nitroglycerin.  Other diagnostic possibilities included
bradycardia (? [**12-25**] amiodarone), volume depletion, vasovagal
