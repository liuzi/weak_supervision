SIRS 4 PROGRESS NOTE [**2152-7-29**]
Assessment and Plan:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]F with a history of COPD, alzheimer's dementia,
and aspiration who presented from her nursing home in acute
respiratory distress after eating lunch.

# Respiratory Distress: Possibly secondary to aspiration, which
is consistent with the presentation 1.5 hours after lunch.
Initial CXR showed multiple reticular opacities but no
consolidations. Repeat CXR showed less prominant bilateral
opacifications, though there is possible bilateral pleural
effusions with some compressed atelectasis at the bases.
Initially on Vancomycin and Cefepime, switched to IV Ceftriaxone
to treat UTI since pna was unlikely. IVF was at 40cc/ml for the
last 3 days of her hospitalization. PO trial of thick liquids
started on [**2152-7-29**], which pt tolerated well. Lungs sounded a lot
clearer with residual right base crackles. Pt breathing
comfortably at 94% O2 sat on room air.

# Abnormal EKG - Admission EKG read yesterday by Cardiology, who
was concerned about possible acute event. However, EKG compared
with one in [**2142**], which also showed similar changes. Troponins
elevated at 0.06 x 2 but did not trend up, likely from transient
ischemia due to increased cardiac demand [**12-30**] infection. No signs
of acute cardiac event. Medical management with beta blocker,
asa discussed with family, who declined due to allergy to asa
and desire for minimal medication.  Patient did tolerate
beta-blocker (metoprolol 6.25mg) for one dose and seemed to perk
up afterwards, but given difficulty in administration here in
the hospital (took patient an hour to swallow pill) did not
continue.  Can be considered as outpatient.

# Sepsis: Resolved. Likely secondary to a UTI. Grossly positive
UA though urine culture was negative, PMH of recurrent UTIs,
recent admission to [**Hospital3 **] with urosepsis from
multi-drug resistant E.coli, necessitating treatment with
primaxin. Straight cath in MICU drained purulent material. Urine
culture showed no growth, but per pt's son, pt had already
received IV abx at that time. Plan to complete 7 day course of
ceftriaxone on [**2152-8-3**].

# Volume status: Tenuous. Per MICU and patient's son, patient
become hypotensive with no fluids but rapidly becomes
hypertensive (up to sbp of 170's)if fluids given too fast. At
present appears to respond well to slow small fluid boluses, at
a rate of 75-100cc/hr. Was continued on IVF at 40cc/hr per pts
son as an amount that she has tolerated well in the past.

# Diabetes Mellitus Type II: Started on ISS on [**2152-7-26**], but NPO,
became hypoglycemic and ISS was downtitrated in the MICU.
Changed to regular insulin sliding. Glucose stable. Januvia held
while inpatient and continued to use reduced dose insulin
slididng scale.  Can restart Januvia on d/c.

# Sacral pressure ulcer: Wound care recs - Plan:  Pressure
redistribution measures, turn and reposition every 1-2 hrs off
back. Limit sit time to 1 hr at time and sit on a pressure
redist cushion.
Protect intact skin midback and coccyx area with Critic aid
Clear
daily and prn or every 3rd cleansing.

# Pruritus: pt developed agitated pruritus starting about 15
minutes after her cefepime infusion two days ago. Resolved on
switch to ceftriaxone.

# Hypokalemia: Resolved after repletion.

#General - PT discontinued because it was too rigorous. Followed
their initial recs of OOBx3 per day.
.
Transitional Issues
- Encourage PO intake
- Completion of ceftriaxone 1gm q24 hrs - last dose on [**2152-8-3**]
- Consideration of maintenance fluids
- Consider beta blocker (per pt's family, pt seemed to perk up
after single dose of metoprolol 6.25mg PO. Systolic BP decreased
to 120's, HR in 70's, Respiration rate to 16-20).
