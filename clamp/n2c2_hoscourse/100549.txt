Ms. [**Known lastname 73078**] is 79 year old pleasant woman with a Past medical
history significant for MDS with AML transformation on Dacogen,
diverticulosis, known cecal AVMs admitted from clinic on [**2195-4-1**]
in the setting of a transfusion reaction to platelets with
thrombocytopenia who was noted to develop bright red blood per
rectum with acute hematocrit drop who underwent repeat
colonoscopy showing non-bleeding diverticulosis of the entire
colon and bleeding angioectasias of the cecum treated with Argon
Plasma coagulation. She required a second colonoscopy for
repeated bloody bowel movements which showed a clot adherent to
the cecum. She remained stable for a while then had frequent
bloody bowel movements again which was controlled by amicar drip
for 8 hours. Gradually her platelets started to increase. After
these events, she remained stable and was discharged home in
stable condition. She will require HLA matched platelet
transfusions in the future if needed.
.
# cecal AVMs:  She was transferred to the ICU twice for bright
red blood per rectum. The patient developed BRBPR, and was found
to have cecal AVMs on colonoscopy s/p APC. Specifically, repeat
colonoscopy demonstrated cecal angioectasias that were actively
bleeding, non-bleeding colonic diverticula and small polyp.
Hemostasis achieved with Argon Plasma coagulation therapy on
[**2195-4-3**].  During her stay she required several units of PRBC and
platelets. After remaining stable, she was transferred back to
the floor however she had the same situation again and was
transferred back to the ICU where she had her second colonoscopy
which showed a clot adherent to the cecum with oozing around the
clot. The clot was not removed (not amenable to endoscopic
management). GI recommended surgical consult for possible
resection however given her underlying disease and low platelet
counts, they felt this will not be a favorable management. After
having stable H/H, she was transferred back to the floor. While
on the floor, she had a few bloody bowel movements however the
night of [**4-17**] she had total of 450 cc bloody watery stools which
required amicar drip for 8 hours (her platelets were in the
40-50's). CTA was negative. Following this, she did not have any
further significant bloody stools. She remained vitally stable
with stable H/H and gradually rising platelet count.
.
# thrombocytopenia: Secondary to chemotherapy and MDS/AML
concerns. Concern for consumptive process following transfusion
of platelets in the setting of possible ITP vs. TTP however
Hematologic smear was without schistocytes and there was no
evidence of renal failure or neurologic concerns; no fevers. The
patient also had two transfusion reactions to platelets when
first admitted. She was premedicated with anti-histamines. While
the patient was actively bleeding, she was also given Amicar (2
grams IV with 1gram/hour IV infusion overnight on [**2195-4-2**]). This
was repeated over the night of [**4-17**] as above. She was found to
have a positive PRA and required HLA matched platelets for all
subsequent transfusions. Her twin sister was tested at Red Cross
for potential candidate to donate platelets for her sister
however since she takes aspirin and plavix, this was not a
suitable option. Of note, her platelet count was improving
already and did not require further platelet transfusions.
Platelet count was in the 90's upon discharge.
.
# transfusion reaction/PRA positive: The patient had transfusion
reaction to platelet transfusion (once in clinic, and once while
on the floor). She was premedicated with famotidine, benadryl,
and hydrocortisone. A blood bank work up was initiated, and the
patient was given group specific platelets. She was found to be
PRA positive and requires HLA matched platelets. However, during
her second episode of BRBPR on [**4-12**], it was found that there was
no more HLA matched platelets available in [**Location (un) 86**] area. Red
Cross was contact[**Name (NI) **] for more HLA matched platelets. Sister was a
potential donor however it wasn't suitable given her
anti-platelet therapy as above. She did not require further
platelet transfusions once her platelet count started to
increase.
.
# MDS with AML transformation:  While the patient was on the
floor, it was noticed that her blast count was trending up and
her neutrophil count was trending down.  It was then decided to
start her on second cycle of Dacogen (day 1 = [**2195-4-8**]).  The
patient tolerated the Dacogen well, with little side effects.
12% blast cells on peripheral blood upon discharge.
.
# GERD: The patient was continued on her home PPI.
.
# constipation:  The patient has a history of severe
constipation, however, her home medications were held in the
setting of her BRBPR and then restarted upon discharge given
resolution of bloody bowel movements.
.
Transitional Issues:
- The patient had transfusion reaction to platelets; a blood
bank work up was initiated and she was found to be PRA positive;
she will require HLA matched platelets for all subsequent
transfusions.
