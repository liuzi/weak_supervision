Mr. [**Known lastname 100424**] is a 78 year old gentleman with stage IV NSCLC
admitted for lactic acidosis.
.
# Lactic acidosis: Anion gap of 15 on admission. During recent
admission ([**6-28**]), no lactate was measured although AG ranged
from [**1-2**] and bicarb 24-26 during admission with albumin >4.
Differential includes type A lactic acidosis (hypoperfusion)
from SIRS in setting of pneumonia or cardiogenic shock from ACS
versus type B lactic acidosis from metformin/diabetes or active
malignancy.  No evidence of liver mets or decreased synthetic
function to suggest inability to clear lactate.  While in the
ICU, the patient's metformin was held, venous lactate levels and
anion gap were followed.  He received maintenence fluids.  His
lactate was downtrending on transfer to the floor.
.
# Chest pain/CAD: Low suspicion for ACS given ECG in ED
unchanged without ST-T wave abnormalities. CTA negative for PE
and patient was CP free throughout his stay in the ICU.  His
home meds including ASA, statin, lisinopril, and nadolol were
continued.
.
# Leukocytosis: likely secondary to dexamethasone, WBC and fever
curve were stable in ICU.
.
# Lung CA: Per primary oncologist, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**], Decadron was
continued.  The patient received whole brain XRT while in the
ICU, with plans to receive another dose the day after ICU
discharge
.
# Ground glass opacities: Patchy ground glass opacities on CT
present in 6/[**2174**].  Given heteregenous nature, unlikely to be
edema.  Less likely to be blood, and low likelihood given
clinical presentation for bacterial infection.  Given recent
dexamethasone therapy, concern for PCP given lack of
prophylaxis, although ground glass present prior to initiation
of dexamethasone makes this less likely.  Pt was started on PCP
prophylaxis with Bactrim
.
# COPD: Advair, tiotropium, and albuterol were continued.
.
# HTN: Home regimen of amlodipine and lisinopril was continued.
.
# Diabetes, type 2: Metformin given lactic acidosis and contrast
load, pt was covered with ISS with accuchecks.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia: Statin was continued, ezetimibe held
given lack of data regarding benefit.
.
# GERD: PPI Continued
