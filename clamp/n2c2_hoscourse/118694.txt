This is a 61 yo female with a history of laryngeal spasm,
possible asthma, and anxiety who is in the ICU for respiratory
distress s/p elective eye surgery.

# Respiratory distress: Felt most likely related to paradoxical
vocal cord motion, although quite difficult to tell from
physical exam alone. Panting maneuver did alleviate wheezing.
ENT evaluated and noted only mild upper airway edema. She was
supported with supplemental oxygen and heliox at time. She did
not require NIV or intubation. She was treated with prn nebs,
but no high dose steroids as this was not felt to be consistent
with asthma exacerbation. No clinical evidence of infection. She
was evaluated by PT and cleared for home. She was walked around
the unit and was saturating at 94% on RA. She felt well and safe
to go home. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (her PCP) was called and he felt as though
she was a good judge of being safe to go home.

# Trabeculectomy/Glaucoma: She had her procedure and tolerated
surgery well. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended Tobramycin drops 4
times a day, Tobraymycin oitnment at night, and apraclonidine
[**Hospital1 **] with follow-up early next week.

# Rheumatoid arthritis: Stable. She was continued on imuran.
Humira was to be continued on [**Hospital1 **] weekly.

# Coronary artery disease: Stable. ASA allergy. Continued on
ticlopidine, BB and statin.

# Diabetes type II: Pt denies dx, more likely hyperglycemia that
is steroid related. She was covered with HISS, and [**Hospital1 **]
with diet control.

# Depression and anxiety: Continued on home meds of Abilify,
Duloxetine, and lorazepam.

# Supraventricular tachycardia: Stable. Continued on digoxin,
verapamil, metoprolol

# HTN: Stable during admission. Continued verapamil and
metoprolol.

# Transition issues: She was [**Hospital1 **] home with follow-up
established with Pulmonology, Ophthalmology, and her PCP.
