Mrs. [**Known lastname 55334**] is an 80 year old female with a history of LMain
and 3VD, moderate aortic stenosis and with status post cardiac
cath for STEMI back on [**2181-7-17**] at OSH that was not intervened
upon by PCI or CABG who then presented to another OSH with an
inferior STEMI on [**2181-7-26**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management and a second opinion regarding options for
revascularization. CABG versus high risk PCI were considered and
CT surgery was consulted. Patient remained chest pain free on
medical management of her CAD, however, the acute renal failure
she presented with evolved rapidly from the beginning of her
course, making either surgical or PCI less of an option. Renal
was consulted and felt her renal failure was likely attributable
to evolving ATN in the setting of poor forward flow related to
her recent MI and possibly due to contrast nephropathy given a
recent catheterization. The patient became oliguric and
subsequently volume overloaded and hypoxic. Aggressive diuresis
with IV lasix and diuril were unsuccessful so CVVH was
initiated. At this point she had become hemodynamically unstable
requiring pressor support with dopamine. Hemodynamic instability
was likely also affected by patient's development of slow atrial
fibrillation which requried placement of a trancutaneous pacer.
Her dopamine requirement increased significantly with CVVH which
likely contributed to the development of metabolic acidosis. On
[**8-4**] the patient was found to have a lactate of 11 and had
developed agonal respirations. She underwent intubation which
did not help to improve her worsening acidemia. The patient's
family decided to change her code status to DNR/DNI and soon
after to CMO when it was clear that her prognosis had become
very poor. She was pronounced dead on [**2181-8-5**] at 0313. Her three
daughters were at her bedside and agreed in declining an
autopsy.
