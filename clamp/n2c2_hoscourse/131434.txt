# PNA: Failed PO levoquin and CURB65 score high enough to be
re-admitted. Likely had resistent bacterial PNA and needs Rx
with IV antibiotics for longer prior to switching to PO. He was
treated with Vanc/ctx/azithro and then switched to
vanc/meropenem/gent/azithro at the recommendations of ID when he
continued to have hypoxia and fevers. A CT showed no abscess or
fluid collection. He underwent bronchoscopy which revealed clear
airways but blood-tinged fluid on BAL. Blood, urine, and sputum
cultures had no growth. Urinary legionella was negative. His
antibiotics were eventually tailored to meropenem, gentamicin,
vancomycin prior to transfer out of MICU and doses increased
according to levels. His oxygenation requirements decreased and
he was transferred out of the MICU. He was treated with mucinex
and codeine as well as nebs PRN for symptom control. his final
antibiotic regimen was vanc to be continued for 5 more days,
gentamycin to be continued for two more days and ciprofloxacin
to be continued for 2 more days. He completed a course of
azithromycin as well as meropenem. PPD was negative.

#  Hyponatremia: likely [**1-28**] to either the PNA or dehydration
from poor po intake. Improved with IVF. Discharge sodium 138.

#  Renal Insufficiency: likely pre-renal [**1-28**] fever and
dehydration from poor po intake. Improved with IVR. Discharge
creatinine 0.8.

# Tachycardia: Likely [**1-28**] dehydration from fever and poor po
intake. Resolved with IVF.

# Diarrhea: likely [**1-28**] ADR from ABx but could be cdiff or [**1-28**]
legionella which would explain both the lung and GI findings.
Urinary legionella was negative and Cdiff negatiee as well.
Diarrhea resolved.

# CAD: Stable. ACE inhibitor and statin held in the setting of
acute illness. Restarted on time of discharge.

# GERD: Continued home nexium
