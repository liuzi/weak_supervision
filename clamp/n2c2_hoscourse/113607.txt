C. difficile colitis/Sepsis: Given history of recurrent C.
difficile colitis, diarrhea, and sepsis, etiology was presumed
to be CDAD, confirmed on stool cx.  She was started on PO vanco,
IV flagyl empirically.  CT scan demonstrated colitis.  Patient
was admitted to the ICU for aggressive IVF, though patient
refused central line.  She was briefly on peripheral levophed.
ID and GI were consulted.  After adequate resuscitation, she
stabilized clinically and was transferred to the medical floor.
Her diarrhea improved, though her flagyl was stopped after she
developed parasthesias.  Reviewing the record, it appeared that
she stopped her previous taper early.  Therefore, a more
aggressive taper was pursued, deferring possible fecal
transplantation to the outpatient setting, as well as rifamixin.
.
ARF: Likely pre-renal.  Resolved with IVF resusitation
.
h/o DVT: Coumadin was reversed initially.  However, once she
stabilized it was restarted with lovenox bridge.  She will need
close follow up to ensure her coumadin returns to therapeutic
range 2-3 and was dicharged on warfarin 4mg daily and lovenox
40mg SC q12 to bridge
.
Plexopathy: Continued coumadin
.
HTN, benign: will restart home antihypertensives on discharge
