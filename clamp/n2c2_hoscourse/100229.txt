44 year-old male with past medical history of ESRD on HD, HCV,
presenting with hypotension and elevated lactate, presumed
sepsis without source found. The patient was noted to have
elevated LFTs on admission. The patient was found to be HIT Ab
positive.
.
1. Sepsis: There was no source found, but patient had received
antibiotics prior to admission. The patient remained afebrile
and hemodynamically stable throughout transfer to the floor. The
patient had leukocytosis on admission but this resolved prior to
transfer. The patient completed an empiric seven-day course of
vancomycin/zosyn and ten-day course of flagyl. The patient's
immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine for history of renal
transplant was discontinued; prednisone 10 mg QOD was continued.
CXR x 2 without evidence of pneumonia. The patient's blood,
urine, stools, and sputum cultures were negative at the time of
discharge. C. difficile toxin B was negative. The patient
complained of continued cough and loose stools which were
improving prior to discharge.
.
2. Hypotension: Resolved prior to transfer to the floor. Likely
sepsis given elevated lactate. Hypovolemia possible in setting
of poor po prior to admission. Cardiac etiology unlikely; no
significant change in cardiac function and cardiac enzymes
unrevealing. Adrenal insufficiency was unlikely with random
cortisol of 36,  however, the patient on chronic steroids; the
patient was continued on prednisone 10 mg every other day for
history of renal transplant. The patient received treatment for
sepsis as above.
.
3. Elevated LFTs/coagulopathy: Secondary to shock liver versus
tylenol toxicity. The patient was initially maintained on
mucomyst gtt but this was discontinued when the patient's liver
function tests improved. There was likely a component of
congestion secondary to CHF. This was unlikely secondary to HCV
as there was no change in immunosuppression and only mild active
inflammation on very recent biopsy. Unlikely to be due to recent
liver biopsy. The patient's liver function tests continued to
trend down prior to discharge.
.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's coumadin was initially
held in the setting of liver failure and elevated INR. The
patient's digoxin and amiodarone were initially held in the
setting of renal and liver failure and the patient's rate was
subsequently poorly-controlled to heart rate 130-140s. The
patient was followed by his primary cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**],
during admission. The patient's amiodarone was restarted and
increased from previous per his recommendations. Digoxin was not
restarted. The patient's elanopril was discontinued on admission
and the patient was started on captopril; there was an attempt
to up-titrate the dose but the patient's blood pressure did not
tolerate the increase. The patient was discharged on captopril
6.25 twice daily. The patient's blood pressure does not tolerate
beta-blocker therapy. The patient was restarted on coumadin
prior to discharge. The patient's rapid ventricular rate is most
likely compensatory for low ejection fraction; rate control to
110-120s is acceptable. The patient's rate was at goal 110s-120s
on discharge. The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] as an
outpatient.
.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine [**5-2**]. The
patient is on HD status post two failed renal transplants. The
differential for the patient's acute renal failure included
acute tubular necrosis and cyclotoxicity (recently on
azithromycin). The patient's ACE inhibitor was initially held.
The patient's creatinine did not improve to baseline and was 7.5
prior to discharge. The patient was followed by the renal
service throughout hospitalization. The patient continued to
receive hemodialysis per his MWF schedule. The patient was
started on sensipar for elevated PTH. The patient was continued
on prednisone 10 mg QOD for history of renal transplant. The
patient's cyclosporine was discontinued. Amphogel was
discontinued and cinecalcet was added to the patient's regimen.
.
6. Thrombocytopenia/HIT Ab positive: HIT antibodies were sent
because of the patient's thrombocytopenia. The patient's HIT
antibodies were positive. The patient had been on heparin SC and
heparin flushes in the MICU but these were discontinued prior to
transfer to the floor. The patient was followed by hematology
during admission. The patient had a right basilic vein
thrombosis visualized but no other signs or symptoms of
thrombosis. After discussion with hematology and pharmacy, the
patient was started on argatroban and bridged to coumadin. The
patient's INR goal was 2.5-3.5 given his history of liver
disease.
.
7. Congestive heart failure. EF of 10% per echo [**12-28**] with 3+ MR,
2+ TR. Mixed ischemic/nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.
Patient has a fixed LAD/anterior defect on MIBI on 2/[**2114**]. The
patient is status post ICD placement [**1-1**]. The patient was
started on captopril as above. The patient's blood pressure does
not tolerate beta-blocker therapy. The patient's volume status
was addressed at hemodialysis. The patient was assessed for
biventricular ICD by EP; the decision was made not to place at
this time given the patient's narrow QRS duration and especially
in the setting of recent sepsis. The patient will follow-up with
Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 437**] in [**5-3**] weeks. The patient will receive
outpatient cardiopulmonary assessment for possible cardiac
transplant.
.
8. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction and
stent [**2105**]. The patient was without complaints of chest pain
throughout admission. The patient was continued on aspirin. The
patient's elanopril was discontinued and the patient was started
on captopril as above. The patient's blood pressure does not
tolerate beta-blocker therapy.
.
9. Nucleated red blood cells. There were 20 NRBC/100 white blood
cells on the patient's blood smear on transfer to the floor,
with low grade hemolysis and high reticulocyte count. Hematology
was consulted and believed this was likely secondary to
hyperactive marrow stimulated in the setting of recent sepsis.
This resolved prior to discharge.
