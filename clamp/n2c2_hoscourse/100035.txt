Mr. [**Known lastname 3234**] is a 36 year old gentleman with a PMH signifciant
with dilated cardiomyopathy s/p AICD, PE not on anticoagulation,
asthma, and HTN admitted to an OSH with dyspnea now the
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU after PEA arrest x2.

# PEA arrest and subsequent anoxic brain injury.: Suspect that
original OSH PEA arrest due to hypoxemia or acidosis, with [**Hospital1 18**]
ED PEA arrest due to acidosis with admission pH 7.16 on arrival.
 TTE with evidence of RV failure to suggest PE. LVEF 30% with
known dilated cardiomyopathy. He was cooled per protocol.
Initially, his EEG was concerning without evident brain
activity. On hospital day 3, there was only comatose activity
and his prognosis was guarded. However, the patient was able to
be weaned off the vent and over the course of the next three
days his mental status improved.  He was alert, oriented to
place and day of the week and moving all 4 extremities.  He
became more interactive on transfer to the floor, was initially
speaking in spanish and English and not always making sense but
then started responding more appropiately and following
commands.  On hospital day 11 he had a witnessed grand mal
seizure and was given ativan and started on Keppra with
neurology consult.  His mental status was worse for 24 hours
after the seizure but then he slowly returned to his recent
baseline.  He was somewhat aggitated so his Keppra was switched
to Topiramate. He had a subsequent seizure on [**3-18**] with LUE
tonic clonic activity and impaired consciousness but this
resolved spontaneously after 1-2 minutes. He was contineud on
topamax per neuro recommendations. OT and PT were consulted and
worked with the patient as he will likely require a long
rehabilitation course.  At the time of discharge the patient was
alert, oriented (though not always to date), following commands
but impulsive with poor motor planning leading to several falls.
 Neurology notes indicate the patient has the potential
toimprove from a neurologic standpoint. He also may have
recurrent seizures which should be treated with ativan IV or IM
and do not neccessarily indicate patient needs to return to
hospital unless they continue for greater than 5 minutes or he
has multiple recurrent seizures or complications such as
aspiration.
-patient will be on Topiramate 25mg PO BID until [**3-22**] PM then
increase to 50mg po BID for seven days then increase to 75mg [**Hospital1 **]
ongoing.
-patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in his s/p
arrest neurology clinic
-patient will require intensive PT and OT in an anoxic brain
injury unit.
.
# Respiratory failure: Believed to be due to status asthmaticus,
although inciting event unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 227**] multiple cardiac arrests,
also a concern for development of ARDS.  The patient was
initially treated broadly with vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl,
cipro, and oseltamavir. He was treated with IV soludemedrol and
albuterol MDI. He was ventialted according to ARDS-Net protocol.
On admission, he had two chest tubes placed for pneumothoraces.
They were removed on hospital day 1. In his first several days,
his respiratory status was comprimised by lobar collapse, first
of the RUL and then of the RML. His extubation was initially
limited both by agitation requiring sedation and by requirements
for high PEEP to maintain oxygenation. His oxygenation was
improved with diuresis and agitation was better controlled with
seroquel. He was extubated on [**3-1**] and respiratory status was
stable.  His Asthma was treated with standing and PRN albuterol
and ipratriopium and a slow prednisone taper which he l
completed on [**2115-3-18**] and he was restarted on Advair
-patient may require additional nebs on top of his standing
advair though his respiratory status has been very stable,
without wheezing for the last week.
- would like benefit from outpatient PFTs and is scheduled to
see a pulmonologist in follow up.
.
# Ventilator associated pneumonia:  Patient developed a fever on
[**2-27**] with new infiltrates on chest xray while intubated. He was
initially covered with vanc/cefepime and cipro. Cipro was
eventually discontinued. He did not grow any organisms other
than yeast in his sputum. He completed an 8 day course of
Vanco/Cefepime.
.
# Myoclonus: when mental status improved, was noted to have
myoclonic jerks. per neurology, likely [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1683**] Syndrome
which is anoxic injury to the purkinje cells.  These jerks
continued for about one week and then became rare.
.
# dilated [**Last Name (LF) 89982**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 30%. s/p ICD.  Patient was
diuresed with IV lasix in the ED and then transitioned to PO
lasix, home dose, on the floor.  His respiratory status remained
stable. Also continued on home dose of carvedilol and Lisinopril
but ACE downtitrated from 40 to 20 when had elevated Cr 1.9 on
[**3-18**] and slightly low BPs high 90s/60s. BP improved to 100s/60s.

.
#Hypertension: Patient's home regimen was continued on the
floor, but his SBP dipped into the high 80s and low 90s so
lisinopril was decreased to 20mg po daily and his SBP remained
100-130.
.
# L1 compression fracture: After the patient fell, he was
complaining of low back pain so a L-spine Xray was performed and
showed L1 compressin fracture with No cord impingement on
imaging.  The patient had no localizing deficits on serial neuro
exam.  He was treated with pain medication including low dose
ultram, standing tylenol and a lidocaine patch.  Calcitonin was
tried for pain with compression fracture but this did not seem
to help with symptoms so was discontinued.
.
# Leukocytosis: WBC >20  persistently in the MICU even after
being treated for infection.  Since no new infection was found
this was presumed [**12-26**] steroids and the leukocytosis improved
with prednisone taper.  WBC 12 on day of discharge
.
# Hyperglycemia: Patient is not known to be a diabetic and was
felt [**12-26**] steroids,  his sugars were controlled on sliding scale
insulin in the hospital but he no longer had insulin
requirements as his prednisone was tapered.
.
#. [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.9 on [**3-18**] from 1.2 which improved to 1.4 on [**3-19**]
with decreasing ACE and 500cc bolus. He should have repeat
creatinine and labs on [**3-22**] to ensure stability.

# Guardianship: Guardianship paperwork was started in the
hospital.
