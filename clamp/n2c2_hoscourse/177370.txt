Initially transferred to MICU for closer monitoring for
development vessicles/bullae or mucosal involvment.  Stable
overnight.  Developed fever to 104 following morning with HR in
the 130s, which improved with fluids, acetaminophen and motrin.
Dilantin held and Keppra started for seizure [**Last Name (LF) 9401**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 724**].

#Rash: Most likely hypersensitivity reaction (DRESS) from
dilantin vs famotidine.  Both were held.  Concerned for SJS
initially, however rash did not appear to involve mucosa or
palms/soles, and no bullae.  Also considered toxic shock
syndrome initially w/ fever and rash, but no tampon use.  No
evidence of meningitis given neck supple, no headache, CSF fluid
does not appear infected, no fluid around abdominal portion of
VP shunt. Seen by dermatology who recommended clobetasol,
hydrocortisone cream, steroids as well as benadryl, Sarna and
atarax.  Rash remained stable, not spreading and perhaps slighty
improving. Her fever decreased and she was able to tolerate PO.
LFTs trending down, Cr stable, but she had a persistant
eosinophilia. Per derm, rash likely to last for several weeks
prior to resolution.  Will follow up with dermatology as an
outpatient.
.
#Fever: Most likely drug reaction.  Infection considered,
however no localizing signs of infection and no sick contacts.
Cultures negative.  No Abx given. Flu negative. Given
acetaminophen and motrin as well as IVF. Temperature trended
down and had normalized at time of discharge.
.
# Tachycardia: Persistant in 90-100s, fluid responsive,
improving when afebrile.  Likely [**3-15**] insensible losses from
fever and rash.  Encouaged PO fluids on discharge, fever control
and close followup.
.
#Malignant melanoma: s/p ICH w/ multiple mets to brain. No
current e/o neurologic defict other than left facial droop
likely residual from previous ICH.  Will follow up as
outpatient.
