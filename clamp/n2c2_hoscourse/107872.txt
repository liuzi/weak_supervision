BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
Mr. [**Known lastname 49249**] is a 54y/o gentleman with HTN, HLD, DM2, CKD
(baseline Cr 2.0-2.2), CAD s/p CABG [**2186**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, and
radial-OM1-OM2) with systolic and diastolic heart failure, who
was re-admitted from clinic for management of [**Last Name (un) **].

#. Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr 2.1, presented
last admission at 2.5, and presented at this admission with
creatinine 5.4 in clinic. His renal function fluctuated, and he
was initially managed with 40mg [**Hospital1 **] torsemide. However, he did
not respond well and had worsening renal function. Accordingly,
he underwent R heart cath, which showed severely elevated right
and left sided filling pressures, severe pulmonary hypertension
and depressed CO/CI. He was admitted to the CCU for milrinone
drip and more aggressive diuresis.
On admission, urine studies suggested pre-renal cause of [**Last Name (un) **]
(FEurea 44% is indeterminate, FENa 0.86%).  Torsemide had been
held between hospital admissions. Nephrology was consulted and
recommended cefazolin to substitute for Nafcillin (though due to
the short time period, they did not believe [**Last Name (un) **] was consistent
with nafcillin-associated acute interstitial nephritis and urine
eosinophils were positive. Sarna lotion and hydroxyzine were
given for symptomatic relief of uremia-related pruritus. Pt's Cr
trended down to mid 3s, plateaued and then steadily rised. After
pt was switched from milrinone drip to dobutamine drip as well
as optimized afterload reduction with hydralazine and Isordil,
Cr consistently trended down. Upon discharge, Cr was 3.3.
.
#. Acute on chronic CHF: Due to continued weight gain and poor
response, he underwent a R heart cath [see above]. Pt's beta
blocker was restarted at a low dose and then later on
discontinued as pt was in decompensated HF and later on put on
dobutamine drip. Afterload reduction was successful while up
titrating hydralazine and Isordil. Upon discharge, pt's BP was
ranging 130-140. Heart failure team believed CHF is both related
to significant dyssynchrony and contractility issues, both most
likely related to ischemia. Pt was diuresed aggressively
throughout course initially with Lasix drip and then
transitioned to IV Lasix boluses with goal of [**3-12**].5L negative in
24h using 120mg boluses. Pt was transitioned to 100mg Torsemide
at discharge. Dyssynchrony component of HF was addressed with
attempting to place CRT-D. Unfortunately, coronary sinus could
not be accessed successfully and thus LV lead was not placed.
Contractility was addressed with dobutamine drip which pt was
discharged with. After starting dobutamine infusion, EF improved
from 20 to 30% on TTE. Pt will need to followup with EP in order
to access LV for appropriate resynchronization and will probably
have a cardiac catheterization to assess coronaries.
.
#. Peripheral IV-associated MSSA bacteremia:
- Changed nafcillin to cefazolin per ID recs; he underwent a [**Date Range **]
this admission, which did not show any valvular vegetations. As
a result, he underwent a shortened course of IV antibiotics (2
weeks), which ended on [**2195-11-2**]. Pt remained afebrile and stable
thereafter.
.
#. Loose stools
- Recent hospital stay could raise concern for C. diff (pt
nauseous, but no f/c). Per patient, he feels that loose stools
began w/ nafcillin. Either way, may contribute to pre-renal
cause of [**Last Name (un) **] (along with recent poor intake). Loose stools
resolved after stopping nafcillin. In addition, he was c. diff
negative.
.
.
#. CAD s/p CABG
Last cath in [**2191**] noted severe native 3VD with patent LIMA-LAD,

SVG-PDA, and Radial-OM1-OM2. TTE on prior showed new inferior
HK. He was continued on ASA, Pravastatin, and beta blocker
(Metoprolol changed to Carvedilol). In the future he needs L
heart catheterization in order to assess grafts/native vessels.
Pt was continued on ASA and statin. Carvedilol was ultimately
held given decompensated heart failure and pt put on dobutamine
infusion.
.
#. Neuropathic & venous stasis ulcers: Pt was seen by wound care
specialist during hospitalization. Ulcers appeared to heal more
optimally when LE edema decreased with aggressive diuresis. Pt
is to followup with PCP to continue DM management and may need
referral to vascular surgery if ulcers persist or worsen.
.
#. Diabetes mellitus: Stable on ISS, and discharged with Lantus
44u at bedtime with ISS.
.
# Iron deficiency anemia: Hct stable during last admission
30-33. Iron studies showed low level of iron and pt was given 5
days of ferric gluconate IV 125mg to replete iron deficit. Pt's
anemia was stable thereafter and discharged with hct of 28.1.

#Elevated INR: Pt's INR was elevated over 2 during hospital
course without anticoagulation. This was attributed to Vitamin K
deficiency secondary to antibiotic use, malnutrition and
malabsorption from congested bowels related to decompensated
CHF. DIC labs were not remarkable. Pt's elevated INR was
refractory to PO Vit K which supported hypothesis of congestion
in GI tract causing malabsorption issues. As pt's nutrition
improved and preload reduction, INR trended down to 1.4 at time
of discharge. Pt was followed by nutrition during stay and would
benefit from outpt nutrition management.

>> TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- follow up with EP regarding CRT lead placement into LV
- could benefit from ACEI once kidney function improves
- readdress restarting carvedilol when HF better controlled off
of dobutamine
- f/u with PCP regarding lower extremity wounds, medication
reconciliation and diabetes management
- would benefit from outpt nutritional support (fluid
restriction, diabetes)
- would benefit from cardiac cath once kidney function stable
and adequate to assess coronaries/ischemic disease related to
heart failure
- f/u with cardiology
