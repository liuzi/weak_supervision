A/P: [**Age over 90 **] F with PMH of RA, THR c/b DVT, s/p IVC filter placement,
admitted to MICU with LGIB.
.
1) LGIB: Patient presented to outside hospital with lower GI
bleed and hypotension.  She received 2 units of FFP and 2 units
of PRBC's at outside hospital and was subsequently transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  She was admitted to the MICU
at [**Hospital1 18**] and GoLytely was administered in preparation for a
colonoscopy.  On admission to this institution, she had a large
drop in her hct from 33.8 to 26.6 and was transfused an
additional 2 units of PRBC's and started on IV PPI.  She was
subsequently hemodynamically stable for the duration of her
hospital course.  EGD/colonoscopy revealed ischemic-appearing
mucosa in the sigmoid colon and severe sigmoid narrowing, which
they were unable to pass with the colonoscope.  She underwent a
diagnostic colonography under fluroscopy for further evaluation
of  stricture vs. obstructing mass.  This study revealed severe
sigmoid diverticulosis and findings consistent with proctitis.
If indeed these findings are consistent ischemic colitis, it may
be related to hypotensive event (reported per PCP) which
occurred at outside hospital.  At time of discharge, she was
hemodynamically stable, and no further intervention was advised.
 This was discussed with both patient's son and her PCP who
stated their agreement with plan for conservative management.
.
2) Access:  At the outside hospital, Ms. [**Known lastname 70011**] had several
unsuccessful attempts at line placement and was transferred with
a guidewire which was felt to be hooked into her IVC filter.  IR
found that in fact this was not the case, and they were able to
remove the wire without difficulty. A left SVC triple lumen
catheter was placed by IR for access in the setting of active GI
bleeding, as patient had a tenuous situation with peripheral
IV's.
.
3) Rheumatoid Arthritis - Patient has a long history of RA for
30 years and is on a slow prednisone taper for recent RA
pericarditis & pleuritis.  Current dose of 20 mg was continued
to prevent adrenal insufficiency.  Her PCP will continue to
manage the slow taper after discharge.
.
4) Leukocytosis:  Most likely due to chronic prednisone.  No
clinical, radiographic, or other laboratory evidence of
infection.
.
5) Afib:  Sotalol was briefly held secondary to concern over
brisk bleeding.  Once GI bleeding had subsided, it was
restarted.  Heart rate was well-controlled.  She is not
currently a candidate for anticoagulation given GI bleed.
.
6) FEN: Received gentle IVFs initially following admission.
Following colonoscopy, diet was slowly advanced from clear
liquids to regular cardiac diet, which patient tolerated well.
Electrolytes were repleted as needed to maintain K>4, Mg>2.
.
7) Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.  Patient has
IVC filter in place given h/o DVT.  PPI for GI prophylaxis.
.
8) Access: L SCV line placed by IR; removed prior to discharge.

.
9) Code status: DNR/DNI
