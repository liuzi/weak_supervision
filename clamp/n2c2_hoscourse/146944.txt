86 yoM with unknown past medical history presents after being
found unresponsive by family member. [**Name (NI) **] had prodrome of
cold-like symptoms per report. It is unclear what was the
precipitant of the profound weakness / loss of consciousness,
but concern exists for cardiac etiology in addition to infection
/ sepsis. The patient was not "down" for long (likely << 24h)
given absence of profound volume depletion, minimal CK
elevation. No evidence of trauma.  He was initially transferred
to the ICU for treatment.  Hospital course is discussed by
problem.
.
ID - Blood cultures were drawn, negative for growth.  Given the
patient's low grade temperature elevation and leukocytosis, as
well as the history of "cold-like" symptoms experienced by
patient, pneumonia was thought to be the most likely source of
infection.  An initial CXR demonstrated an early PNA consistent
with aspiration, so he was started on empiric coverage with
vancomycin/levofloxacin/Flagyl.  The patient went into
respiratory distress secondary to sepsis/pneumonia, and the
patient required intubation.  He was later successfully
extubated. The patient rapidly improved and his lactate
normalized.  His antibiotic coverage was narrowed to
Levofloxacin only and finished a seven day course prior to
discharge.
.
CV - Possible arrhythmic impetus (VT, less likely VF given
period on floor) in setting of unknown history of vascular
disease. An EKG demonstrates LBBB, which could be chronic and
indicate significant CAD.  Given his NSTEMI, with troponin up to
>3.0 and an index of 8, cardiology was consulted for further
recommendations.  Given that the patient was shocked,
hypotensive, and septic; this may have all contributed to the
troponin elevation.  He underwent an echocardiogram with report
as follows: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity
size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is difficult to
assess but is
probably moderately depressed. Overall left ventricular systolic
function
cannot be reliably assessed.
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is
probably mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. At least mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
underestimated.]
He was started on a beta-blocker, aspirin, high dose Statin, and
an ACE inhibitor for medical management.  In addition, a heparin
drip was administered for 48 hours.  However, a few hours after
the second dose of Captopril, the patient developed severe
angioedema with lip and tongue swelling.  The patient was given
Epi, Benadryl, IV steroids and ranitidine immediately, and
anesthesia was consulted for possible intubation, as well as the
ICU team.  The patient was transferred back to the ICU for
airway monitoring, but was able to be medically managed without
intubation.  Allergy service was consulted, and felt that this
was consistent with an ACE-I allergy rather than a C-1
deficiency.  The C-1 assay was sent to rule out deficiency, with
the results still pending at the time of discharge.  The
patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**], and a follow-up appointment with an
outside cardiologist was arranged prior to discharge.  He was
also started on Norvasc to help optimize his blood pressure
control.
.
Renal- He was initially in acute renal failure, with a
creatinine of 1.8 on admission.  Although his baseline was
unknown, it resolved to 1.1.  His Foley was discontinued, and he
urinated without difficulty.  A microalbumin was sent, which was
negative, therefore initiating [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] was deferred by now.
According to the allergy service, there is some risk of allergy
with [**Last Name (un) **], although very low.
.
Endocrine- Given that he had a history of "borderline" diabetes,
he was monitored with FS QID and covered with an ISS,
particularly in the setting of steroids for angioedema.  A free
T4 was normal, and a urine for microalbumin shows alb/creatinine
ratio 27.6.
.
Heme- He was found to have anemia, normocytic, hct since
admission 33-38, then improved to 40.  He was guaiac negative,
and iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
.
He was evaluated by PT and was cleared for a home discharge with
services.  His PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] prior to discharge, and the
patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment within one
week of discharge.
