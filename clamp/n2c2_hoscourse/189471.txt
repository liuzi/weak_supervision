Patient is a 74 year-old female with CAD, DMII, CHF, AFib, and
COPD who was initially admitted to the MICU for bradycardia,
hypotension, and acute renal failure. The following issues were
addressed during her hospital stay:
.
# HYPOTENSION/BRADYCARDIA
In the MICU, hypotension/bradycardia was attributed to decreased
clearance of nodal agents in setting of ARF (vs. accidental
overdose on medications). Patient responded well to IV fluid
boluses and withholding of anti-hypertensives (patient was on
significant doses of Coreg and Cartia). Clinical suspicion for
tamponade was low, and no pulsus on exam was noted; ECHO
confirmed clinical suspicion. On transfer to the floor,
hypotension was no longer an issue, and medications were
cautiously added at lower dosages. Patient to follow-up with PCP
and cardiologist for further titration of medications as
tolerated.
.
# DIARRHEA/NAUSEA/VOMITING/ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
Patient without history of renal insufficiency admitted with Cr
of 6.7. Patient with long course of what appeared to be viral
gastrointestinal illness precipitating dehydration and worsening
renal function. No other source could be identified, stool
assays were unremarkable. Renal U/S was with evidence of
nephrolithiasis with focal hydronephrosis, but this was
unchanged from a prior study. ARF was pre-renal in nature, and
highly responsive to IV fluid hydration. Patient's Cr steadily
improved to 0.9 on discharge. Patient was referred to Urology as
an outpatient for further work-up of kidney stones. Patient's
nausea/vomiting improved as renal function returned to baseline,
and patient was tolerating PO meals x 48 hours at time of
discharge.
.
# CHF
Lasix was initially held in setting of hypotension. Clinical
exam for the first several days remained without evidence of
fluid overload. ECHO showed 4+ TR, patient highly pre-load
dependent. Lasix and Spironolactone were added back as blood
pressure improved. To follow-up with outpatient cardiologist.
.
# CAD
Patient was chest-pain free on admission. Serial cardiac enzymes
were negative for acute coronary syndrome, in investigating
etiology for bradycardia and hypotension. ASA and Zocor were
continued at outpatient dosages. Quinapril was held secondary to
above reasons, and added back when tolerated.
.
# COPD
Patient was maintained on Atrovent QID, and was without
difficulty breathing or desaturation as inpatient.
.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
Patient's INR was supratherapeutic on admission. Coumadin was
re-started once INR < 3.
