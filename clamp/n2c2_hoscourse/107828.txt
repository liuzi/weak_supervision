A and P/ 51 M with HCV cirrhosis s/p liver transplant in [**3-6**],
CHF, DVT in [**4-4**], who presented with n/v x1 related to dophoff
tube and for further evaluation of a fluid collection in the
gallbladder fossa. The fluid collection was percutaneously
drained, with negative culture and showed resolution on
following CT scans of the abdomen.  Since he had very poor PO
intake and had lost enteral access, a feeding jejunostomy was
placed [**2148-10-26**].  Following that he developed a prolonged ileus,
partial obstruction around the J-tube, requiring re-operation.
Postoperative from the inital jejunostomy, his liver function
deteriorated, and he developed klebsiella sepsis.  Given the
overall poor prognosis, he was made CMO on POD22 and expired on
POD23.
