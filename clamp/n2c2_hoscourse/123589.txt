Ms. [**Known lastname 92101**] is a 59yo woman who presented w/ altered mental
status in the setting of Hep C cirrhosis.

# Altered Mental Status: Given her hx of hep C cirrhosis and
recent TIPs procedure, her AMS was thought to be most likely due
to hepatic encephalopathyy. She was reported to have a hx of
poor compliance with lactulose at home.  Of note, she has not
had other episodes of hepatic encephalopathy prior to this.
Head CT at OSH was negative.  Given her leukocytosis on
admission, infection, particularly SBP or pneumonia, were also
considered. Overdose was also a possibility, although family
denies drug use. Upon arrival in the MICU she was started on
lactulose and rifaximine. She underwent a paracentesis to eval
for SBP, which had a negative gram stain and culture. Given her
AMS, she was considered high risk for aspiration, and she was
started on empiric treatment with vanc/aztreonam/azithromycin
(allergic to cipro and keflex) for nosocomial or aspiration PNA
vs SBP. While there was no known hx of EtOH abuse, thiamine IV
was administered. On exam the pt had some focal findings of
persistent right-[**Hospital1 **] and downward deviation of her eyes, with
inability to track past midline. She had a repeat head CT and an
MRI/MRA which were both without evidence of significant
pathology. Following extubation and decreased sedation, her
mental status improved and the focal eye findings resolved.
While not back at her baseline, pt was awake, alert, and
oriented x3 when she was transferred to the floor. Pt seen by
Neurology, but had already had significant improvement and no
focal findings. On the floor, her mental status continued to
improve. At time of discharge, she is back to baseline,
conversational, oriented x3 but at times is tearful. She is
being discharged on Rifaximin and furosemide.

# Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated for airway
protection at OSH.  Her CXR here suggested a possible aspiration
pneumonia, which could have been [**3-12**] to her AMS.  It is unclear
if she received IVF at OSH. She was weaned off of the vent
quickly as she required minimal pressure support and had good
RSBIs. She was extubated on [**2185-11-17**] was satting well on room air
at the time of transfer to the floor. On discharge, she
continues to have oxygen saturations in the high 90's on room
air.
.
# Rash: Pt arrived in the MICU with three skin findings. Bullae,
blisters/breakdown, and a  diffuse maculopapular rash on
proximal legs and trunk. Dermatology was consulted. The blisters
and bullae were thought to be [**3-12**] trauma in the setting of
coagulopathy due to liver disease and thinned skin. Urine
Porphobilinogens were checked to rule out porphyria in the
setting of Hep C liver disease and were negative. The diffuse
maculopapular rash appeared to be new, and looks more like a
hypersensitivity reaction, likely to ertapenem. Pt has known
allergies to Keflex ad Cipro, and had received ertapenem at the
OSH. She was treated with topical clobetasol cream to the rash
on abdomen and lower extremities (avoiding folds), and
hydrocortisone 2.5% cream to rash in folds of abdomen and groin.
Also, the bullae over time evolved into ulcerations on the pt's
legs, arms and left shoulder which were treated with wound care
as recommended by our wound care team and plastics.
.
# Cirrhosis [**3-12**] Hep C: Pt was treated as described above with
lactulose and rifaximine as well as a PPI, and was followed by
Hepatology.  She had a RUQ ultrasound on [**11-16**] and again on [**11-23**]
which showed her TIPS was patent. She should have a repeats TIPS
ultrasound in 1 month. She had a 5L paracentesis on [**11-20**] which
was negative for increased WBC and culture was sterile.
.
# VRE: Pt had blood culture [**11-16**] which grew VRE sensitive to
daptomycin and linezolid in [**2-11**] bottles. Daptomycin was started
on [**11-17**].  ID was consulted in house. TTE showed no vegetations
on [**11-24**].  The pt should be continued on IV daptomycin to
complete a 14 day course on [**2185-12-2**].
.
# Sinus tachycardia: Pt was likely intravascularly dry on
admission given Hct above baseline, poor urine output, and
tachycardia above baseline, although some level of tachyardia
appears to be chronic in her.  Also may be exacerbated by acute
illness. She received albumin 25g in 500cc NS x2 and her HR and
urine output were followed. Her diuretics were held until the
next morning. At discharge, her HR remains in the 80's to 90's.
.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure: Appeared hypovolemic
admission, her diuretics were held as above. Her diuretics were
gradually restarted on the floor. She is not accumulating
ascited at the time of discharge.
.
# Chronic Kidney Disease:  baseline Cr 1.8-2.0, Cr on discharge
1.5, urine output initially poor on admission, but improved
after fluid challenge.
.
# Thyroid nodule: Should be followed up as outpatient.
.
# Hyponatremia: Pt has chronic hyponatremia seen on past
admission with baseline 128-130. As diuretics were increased,
her sodium gradually decreased to 129 on day of discharge.
Treatment ongoing for this condition should include ongoing
fluid restriction to approximately 1500cc/day.
.
# Hypercalcemia: Pt had transient hypercalcemia to 10.8 this
admission thought to be [**3-12**] Calcium and vitamin D use at home.
These were stopped and Ca is now 9.9 at time of discharge.
Recommend not restarting these medications at this time.
.
# [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt with thrombocytopenia this admission
thought [**3-12**] chronic liver disease. Plt at discharge are 164.
