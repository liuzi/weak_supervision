Patient is an 85 year old male with history of AF s/p CV at OSH
with resultant tachy/brady s/p AF ablation on [**2-14**] started on
dofetilide, CCB and beta blocker now presents with presyncope
and bradycardia likely related to medication. Now off dilt and
metoprolol and on dofetilide and acebutolol with symptomatic
improvement. This hospitalization is complicated by ongoing fall
in HCT with expansion of his bilat groin hematomas R>L now s/p r
hematoma evacuation.
.
## Bilateral groin hematomas: He had bilateral groin hematomas,
and had a hematocrit drop betwee his ablation and this admission
from about 30 --> 24. He had groin ultrasound that showed
bilateral hematomas but no pseudoaneurysm. S/p drainage and
hematoma evacuation by vascular surgery [**2135-2-20**]. Now with one JP
drain in place. Pt denies pain. No transfusions since [**2-21**].

tachycardia recently here for AF ablation on [**2-14**] with 2 of 4
atrial arrhythmias ablated. Discharged on [**2-15**] on Dofetelide,
Cardizem and Metoprolol in normal sinus rhythm. Returns with
near syncopal episodes and sinus bradycardia, likely medication
related. Symptoms are likely exacerbated in setting of anemia.
Cardizem and metoprolol discontinued and he was discahrged on
acebutolol and dofetilide for rate and rhythm control which he
tolerated. HOLD coumadin with lovenox for now pending HCT
stabilization. Should be restarted at follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
