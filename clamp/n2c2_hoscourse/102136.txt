49M with h/o familial myoclonus, depression, EtOH abuse
transferred from HRI [**Location (un) **] for due to changes in mental
status.
.
#. acute mental status changes: Initially the pt was quite
agitated and confused, and was transferred to the ICU due to
demanding nursing care. He was placed in restraints and given 1x
5mg zyprexa and 2mg ativan IV for agitation. Broad differential
initially included infectious, ischemic, metabolic, toxic,
withdrawal symptoms, and psych. Likely not infectious - no
elevated WBC, no fever, UA negative, CXR negative. Likely not
ischemic - EKG normal, CT head negative. Ca, glucose, ammonia
normal. Pt was also not hypoxic. Hepatic encephalopathy was
unlikely as patient does not have ascites, no appreciable
asterixis. His TSH, B12, folate were all normal. Most likely
causes are EtOH withdrawal (EtOH on tox screen negative) with
concurrent Benzo intoxication (pos on tox screen and received
450mg librium over 4 days at HRI [**Location (un) **]), or depression with
psychosis. Psych was consulted and felt that benzo intoxication
was likely. There were no hemodynamic signs of withdrawal, pt
was placed on CIWA scale but did not require any benzos. He
improved with rest, IV fluids, and treatment with vitamins (MVI,
folate, thiamine, B vits). Upon discharge the pt was feeling
much better and was AOx3, cooperative, ambulatory, tolerating a
normal diet with stable vitals (never had any evidence of ETOH
withdrawal during his admission). We recommend to not treat the
patient with benzos as he is not withdrawing and to continue
monitoring and supportive care with nutrition, PT (ambulation),
and social work for long term support. Notably, he also has
allergies to haldol (unknown reaction) so this drug should be
avoided.
.
# Psych / familial myoclonus - psych service was consulted and
we held the pt's  vistaril, lexapro, inderal and topamax.
Psychiatry recommended to hold his psych meds until further
outpatient evaluation.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - Pt has low platelet count of 102, which is
likely secondary to chronic EtOH use. We continued to monitor
and upon discharge the pt's Plt count was improved to 171.
