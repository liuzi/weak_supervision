A/P: 77-year-old male with a history of systolic CHF with EF of
20%, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, COPD, CAD who was admitted
to the MICU [**1-7**] with hypotension thought to be due to
hypovolemia now resolved after iv hydration.
.
#Hypotension: likely hypovolemia due to dehydration from
diuretic use and drinking of ETOH at home. Pt did not have any
infectious symptoms such as fever, leukocytosis or other
localizing symptoms. Hypotension resolved with 2L IVF. EKG not
suggestive of ischemia and cardiac enzymes were negative. TSH
and cortisol not pursued as pt's symptoms resolved after IV
fluids. However, BP still ranged at times from high 90's-110's
and pt was asymptomatic and ambulating without dizziness or
difficulty. Orthostatics were negative after IV hydration. Pt's
lasix, spironolactone, HCTZ, and [**Last Name (un) **] were held during admission
as well as tamsulosin. He was advised to continue to hold these
medications upon discharge. Carvedilol was restarted. ECHO was
repeated to ensure that cardiac function had not worsened and
was found to be similiar to prior with EF 20-25%. Pt will be
discharged on half dose of his valsartan 80mg daily.
++could have been due to increased ETOH prior to admit. Pt did
not have any suggestion of ETOH withdrawal during admission and
it did not appear that drinking ETOH is the norm for the
patient, but that he had more drinks than normal weekend prior
to admission. However, he should be continually advised to
refrain from excess ETOH given his CHF. Pt did not display signs
of clinical CHF during admission.
.
#acute on chronic renal failure-Presented with Cr 2.6. Baseline
1.2-1.5. Thought to be due to hypovolemia in the setting of
diuretic use. Improved during admission to baseline of 1.3 with
IVF and holding diuretics. Will continue to hold lasix, HCTZ,
spironolactone upon DC. Resumed valsartan at 80mg (1/2home dose)
upon DC.  Pt should have repeat labs at his PCP appointment on
[**2183-1-16**] to ensure stability of renal function.
.
#Systolic heart failure: EF 20%. Pt did not appear to have acute
heart failure during admission. Repeat ECHO was unchanged from
prior. Carvedilol was restarted. Pt was given an rx for
valsartan 80mg daily ([**11-18**] home dose) upon discharge. His lasix,
spironolactone, and HCTZ were not restarted during admission. He
was set up with VNA services upon discharge to help monitor for
signs of clinical heart failure in this setting of medication
adjustment.  BP range high 90's-110s during admission off these
agents. Pt should follow up with PCP and cardiology
(appointments listed below) in order to continue further
titration of these medications prn.  Pt should have repeat
chemistry panel at upcoming PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 648**]. Daily weights.
.
#Afib: rate controlled. Continued Carvedilol. INR initially
slightly supratherapeutic, but then starting [**1-8**] his home
regimen of 4mg alternating with 2mg daily was started. Started
with 4mg daily on [**1-8**]. INR can be rechecked at PCP's
appointment on [**2183-1-16**]. INR 3.1, 2, 2.6, 2.2 on day of DC.
.
#HLD: continued pravastatin
.
#BPH: held tamsulosin for now. Continued finasteride
.
#Reactive airways, ?COPD- continued inhalers, no sign of acute
exacerbation.
.
#FEN: cardiac diet
.
#PPX:
--therapeutic INR

Transitional issues
-close monitoring of volume status with lasix, HCTZ, and
spironolactone being held. Restart prn
-monitoring of chemistries, INR on [**2183-1-16**] PCP appointment
[**Name9 (PRE) 48233**] further discussion about ETOH intake
-consider TSH, cortisol should low grade hypotension continue to
be an issue
