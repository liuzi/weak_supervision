Mr. [**Known lastname 14611**] is a 49 year old male with a history of type II
diabetes, charcot's foot s/p multiple surgeries, and previous
MRSA infections who presents with left foot cellulitis,
ulceration, and a resolving DKA. He developed drug rash allergy
on his neck and back while in the ED.
.
1. Left foot abscess/cellulitis/drug reaction:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14611**] presented to his podiatrist on [**2149-2-21**] with two days
of nausea, vomiting(clear, non-bilious, non bloody) , productive
cough (sputum color not noted), fatigue, and pain and redness of
his left foot.  He was found to have a draining wound
(approximately 1 cm in width x 1 cm in depth) on his left lower
leg, just superior to the lateral malleolus with an area of
surrounding cellulitis. He as admitted to the ED for IV
antibiotics and observation. In the ED 2 liters of IV fluid, a
dose of Vancomycin x1 (for cellulitis, first dose [**2149-2-22**]), and
a percocet and transferred to the MICU for further management.
In the MICU he was treated with his 5th liter of normal saline.
He was stable with a heart rate of  77 and a blood pressure of
140/66. Podiatry reported that plain film imaging showed
"interval osteolysis adjacent to the fixation screws that is
suggestive of infection or interval loosening".  Blood and swab
cultures were obtained, and a urine culture was negative for
growth. He was then admitted to the medicine floor for further
management. On the floor He was continued on Vancomycin 1g [**Hospital1 **]
and started on Zosyn (Pip-tazo) 4.5g Q8H on [**2149-2-22**]. He also
developed a allergic reaction on his back, which appeared as
erythematous, non-raised target lesions. He was taken by
podiatry to the operating room on [**2149-2-24**] for surgical
debridement of his foot ulcer, and found to have an abscess that
was drained. Wound cultures grew Klebissela pneuomiae with
sensitivites to Cipro, Meropenum, Gent, ceftriaxone and less
sensitivities to Zosyn, amp/sublactam. He was continued on Vanc,
but the Zosyn was stopped and he was started on Cipro (500mg PO
bid) on [**2149-2-25**]. Wound cultures came back with gram positive
cocci, so he was started on Keflex PO 500mg qid (first dose
[**2149-2-26**].)Mr. [**Known lastname 24962**] improved with pain management after the
debridement, and underwent surgical closure on [**2149-3-3**] and was
discharged in good condition.
.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis:
The patient presented to the emergency department with a glucose
of 377, Anion Gap of  24, lactate of 1.2 and ketones in this
urine, consistent with Diabetic Ketoacidosis. Of note he also
had missed his previous 4 doses of lantus insulin.
He was given 6 units of insulin, 2 liters of IV fluid and
transferred to the MICU where he was started on an inslin drip.
His anion gap eventually close, he glucose was controlled in the
150-240's range, and his anion gap closed before he was admitted
to the medicine floor. On the medicine floor the patient was
followed by the [**Hospital **] clinic. His lantus dose was reduced to
half while he was NPO before procedures, and kept at 20mg [**Hospital1 **]
when eating regularly. His humalog scale was increased 2 units
during his stay because of increasing glucose levels. Upon
discharge his glucose was stable at 163 and his anion gap was
12.
.

3. Anemia: [**Known lastname 14611**] had a hematocrit of 27.3 on admission, with a
range of 24.4 to 28.3, with a discharge hematocrit of 26.7. Of
note, he loss 300cc of blood during  the surgical debridement of
his foot ulcer on [**2149-2-24**]. Two units of blood were cross and
matched, but a transfusion was not needed. He was mainted on
Iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate, 325mg PO. His anemia
was stable at discharge.
.

4. Skin lesions: The patient has developed blanching, raised,
erythematous lesions with a target like appearance on his back
and neck in a similar distribution to a previous admission in
[**2148-10-12**]. Dermatology consulted on the patient, and a biopsy
was performed and found to be consistent with a drug reaction,
although erythema multiforme could not be excluded. The patient
was treated with HydrOXYzine 25 mg PO PRN/Q6H, and Sarna lotion
application PRN. The drug allergy improved over the course of
the admission and was stable at discharge. A follow up
appointment was made with the allergy clinic for the patient.
