In Brief, the patient is an 88 year old man with severe ischemic
cardiomyopathy s/p BiV-ICD placement, atrial flutter, CAD,
chronic kidney disease who presented with hypoxic respiratory
failure and shock which was stablized.  His course was further
complicated by acute abdomial pain, psoas muscle hematoma, upper
GI bleed, acute on chronic renal failure, heparin induced
thrombocytopenia with upper extremity DVT, intermittent hypoxia,
and urinary retention.
.

1) Shock - Patient intially presented in shock requiring
vasopressors.  Cardiac index was normal with decreased SVR which
were not consistent with cardiogenic shock. The likely cause of
was distributive/septic shock of unclear source of infection.
He completed a full course of empiric antibiotics.  He completed
7 days of hydrocortisone/fludrocort for sub-optimal response to
ACTH.  BP stablized by time of discharge.
.
2) Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented in
hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to CHF,
hypoventilation and decreased mental status.  He was intubated
prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  He was weaned from the ventilator
successfully.  He did have intermittent hypoxia largely
secondary to pulmonary edema from inadequate diuresis.  He was
stabilized on standing twice daily lasix. He was started on
BiPaP at night for hypoventilation.
.
3) Abdominal pain - During the hospital stay he developed acute
severe epigastric pain.  He was transfered to the MICU for
concern for mesenteric ischemia.  An abominal CTA was negative
for this.  A surgery consult was obtained and recommended no
surgical intervention.  The pain resolved without specific
intervention. He was subsequently found to have an psoas muscle
hematoma and required several blood transfusions with
appropriate response in his hematocrit.

4) Cardiovascular:
a. CAD- history of MI s/p CABG. will continue ASA, simvastatin,
beta-blocker.
.
b. Pump- Severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 10-15% s/p
BiV-ICD placement. No evidence of cardiogenic shock upon initial
presenation as C.I. was normal.  Medically managed CHF with
ACEi, beta-blocker, digoxin, spironolactone, furosemide.
.
c. rhythm- [**Hospital1 **]-V paced with underlying rhythm is atrial
flutter/fibrillation. Started on amiodarone for maintenance of
sinus rhythm to maximize likelihood of atrial kick. Also,
amiodarone to decrease in-appropriate shocks from ICD.

5) Upper GI bleed - The patient did develop guaiac positive
stools in the setting of anticoagulation for the atrial
fibrillation. The hematocrit drop was largely due to the psoas
hematoma as above.  The patient refused EGD.  If the patient
develops recurrent melenotic stools he could be referred to GI
for endoscopy.  He will continue on a PPI.
.
6)Acute on Chronic Renal failure - Initial creatinine down from
admission to peak 2.5 this was likely from pre-renal secondary
to shock state; no evidence of ATN. By time of discharge, the
creatinine had resolved to baseline.
.
7) Anemia-  In addition the the acute blood loss anemia as
described above.  The patient has a chronic microcytic anemia.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease
(labs drawn before blood transfusions were given).  Also with
regard to the significant microcytosis and his Italian
extraction, hemoglobin electrophoresis was performed to evaluate
for thallasemia.  These results were pending at time of
discharge.
.
8) Thrombocytopenia - HIT type II. PF4 positive on [**2120-12-27**],
Platelets stable at around 70K with subsequent recovery to
greater than 150K. He did have a left upper extremity venous
clot although the developement of this was after his platelets
had stabilized.  Started argatroban on [**2120-12-27**] with transition
to coumadin.  He continued on argatroban until his INR on
combined anti-coagulation was >4. At which time he was
maintained on coumadin alone.
.
9) Urinary retention: - The patient has no prior history of
urinary retention, nocturia, frequency or related BPH symptoms.
During one attempt at removing the foley catheter he had
decreased urine output with a large volume detected on bladder
scan.  The foley was replaced.  He was started on finasteride,
not wanting to use an alpha-blocker that would likely cause
hypotension when added to his extensive cardiac regimen.  The
catheter was left in at discharge.  This should be removed in
[**2-9**] days followed by confirmation that the patient can urinate.
.
10) Code Status: DNR/DNI confirmed with patient and HCP.
.
11) Dispo: the patient was discharged to rehab
