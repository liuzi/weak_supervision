Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Hepatobiliary Surgical Service
on [**2138-8-13**] with abdominal pain and weakness as described above.
His initial labs demonstrated a significant anemia, with a
hematocrit of 19.7. Further review of his history raised the
possibility of an upper GI bleed, as it was determined he had
been taking high doses of NSAIDs for his abdominal pain, and had
unclear history of melanotic stools and/or blood-tinged emesis.
He was initially admitted to the Surgical ICU, where he was
stabilized with 2 units of packed red blood cells. His
hematocrit then rose to 23.4, at which time he was transfused an
additional 2 units. His hematocrit then stabilized at 28.2.

A CT of his abdomen performed shortly after admission on [**2138-8-13**]
revealed the following:
1.  Extensive hepatic lesions (presumably HCC) with extensive
mesenteric root, porta hepatis lymphadenopathy, and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy as well as mesenteric/omental implants and
possible pancreatic and mesenteric vein invasion as described
above.  Nonhemorrhagic ascites. No areas of active hemorrhage
within the mass lesions or along the course of the bowel are
present.
2.  Gastroesophageal varices.
3.  Nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis. New bilateral pulmonary nodules concerning for
metastases.

Given the size and distribution of his hepatic lesions, Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was determined to be not eligible for surgical
resection. Mr. [**Known lastname **] also received an esophago-gastric
endoscopy to evaluate his suspected upper GI bleed, anemia, and
abdominal pain. This study revealed the following:
- [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] B distal esophagitis, 2 cords of small esophageal
varices without red whale signs left undisturbed, irregular GEJ
with 2 tongues of salmon like mucosa left undisturbed.
- Diffuse mild to modorate erythema with deformed antrum and
pyloric area. One small 1cm clean based ulcer with surrounding
edema and erythema left undisturbed. Retroflex view revealed a
moderate hiatal hernia, hiatus ~3cm.
- Duodenitis and one small <1cm superficial clean based ulcer in
the duodenal bulb left undisturbed, normal second portion.
- Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum.

The etiology of his anemia was determined to be a combination of
hepatic lesions/HCC as well as upper GI bleed, possibly
secondary to NSAID use. After hemodynamic and cardiovascular
stabilization with transfusions as above, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
transferred out of the SICU to the surgical floor. His liver
lesions and clinical case was discussed during a
multi-disciplinary hepatic tumor conference. It was determined
he would benefit from biopsy of his lesions, with possible
systemic therapy to be determined as an outpatient. Mr.
[**Known lastname **] future outpatient care was coordinated with the
hematology-oncology service, and he was discharged on [**8-16**], [**2137**].
