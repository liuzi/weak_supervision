1) Acute renal failure: Developed after transfer from OSH,
likely ATN secondary to contrast load on [**2183-8-30**] + SIRS +
hypotension in the ICU overnight the evening of [**2183-8-31**]. FENa
5%, lytes remained stable. Patient was given continuous IV
fluids and developed post-ATN diuresis complicated by one
episode of hypernatremia. Her creatinine slowly improved and was
1.5 at the time of discharge.
.
2) ?Multifocal pneumonia: Could very well have represented ARDS,
but given fevers, persistent oxygen requirement and concerning
CT at OSH patient was treated with Vanc/Zosyn. Blood cultures
were sent at the OSH and remained negative. Patient was weaned
off of oxygen and remained stable on room air.
.
3) Pancreatitis: Lipase significantly decreased by the time of
transfer; patient was never nauseous or with abdominal pain.
ERCP was not felt to be indicated and she was followed
clinically as her diet was advanced. A repeat MRCP performed on
[**2183-9-11**] was normal.
.
4) Intermittent fevers: Patient had continued low-grade fevers
throughout her hospital stay. CXR, UA, blood cultures, and MRCP
were unrevealing. Infectious disease was consulted and
suggested that a drug reaction to penicillin be considered as
part of the differential diagnosis, but also recommended Hep C,
Hep B, RPR, and HIV as initial work up. These were obtained and
returned negative prior to the patient's discharge except for
the Hepatitis C serologies which are still pending. As the
workup was in progress, the patient's fever curve decreased and
she subsequently became afebrile 3 days prior to her discharge.
Because the patient deffervesced, the infectious disease service
did not feel that an echocardiogram, blood smears for parasites,
or other serologies needed to be pursued as an inpatient. The
service made two other recommendations:
A) a shorter follow up interval for her small lung nodule than
12 months due to her history of fever.
B) That after her acute illness subsided to consider checking
crp, esr and nuclear medicine studies if all else was negative;
and to also consider checking anaplasma/ehrlichia serologies,
anca, [**Doctor First Name **], spep/upep and consider Rheumatological evaluation +/-
Oncology evaluation.
.
5) Maculo papular rash: The patient developed a rash across her
abdomen, back and all 4 extremities 4 days prior to her
discharge. The rash was thought to be part of a possible drug
reaction to penicillins although the timing was after she had
discontinued her zosyn. It was treated with benedryl and sarna
and almost completely resolved by the time of discharge.
.
6) Increased mediastinal lymphadenpathy and 5mm lung nodule on
CT as noted above -  requires follow-up in [**4-30**] months.
