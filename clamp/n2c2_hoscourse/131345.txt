Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 24 year old woman with SLE, CKD V, and multiple
admissions for labile hypertension who presented to the ED
complaining of about a weeks?????? worth of right leg pain. She was
initially admitted to the MICU for hypertensive urgency and then
transfered to the floor after a day.

# Hypertensive urgency: had been on labetalol drip in the ED,
but this was stopped due to nausea (presumed that her BP was
coming down too fast).  She was started on her home meds and
tolerated these fairly well.  Transferred to the floor and noted
to have SPBs in the 90s.  She required 1L IVF bolus since her
baseline SBP is thought to run in the 130-170 range.  She also
had transient dizziness during this episode.  BP meds were held
and later that night her SBP was in the 220s.  BP meds
restarted.  She remained stable thereafter with SBPs in the
130-170s.  We opted to discharge her on her home regimen
(without decreasing doses) since she is more often having issues
with elevated blood pressures.
.
# Right leg pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or fracture
on plain film. MRI and plain films were ordered and showed no
acute pathology.  The pain was in the distribution of her right
hamstring and was worsened when it was stretched thus suggesting
a muscle injury.  CK was normal.  Pain was treated with dilaudid
initially.  On day of discharge, she was able to ambulate
without gait abnormality or pain.  PT saw her and rec outpt PT
followup.
.
# CKD V: PD catheter placement in place. Pt was tried on PD on a
number of occasions but did not tolerate it [**2-11**] pain.  KUB
confirmed tip in place.  Cx of peritoneal fluid not suggestive
of peritonitis.  K remained mildly elevated.  Hyperpara treated
with sevelamer (although patient refused) then tums.  Pt will
reconsider PD as outpatient.
.
# Anemia: chronic.  Received 2u pRBC while inhouse for Hct in
the 18-19 range.  Had appropriate response.  Not on Epo given
hypertension
.
# ID: Rx with cipro for ? UTI although urine cx neg.  Also had
temp to 101 on evening prior to discharge.  No clear source.  PD
fluid cultured and NGTD.  Pt remainded HD stable on day of
discharge.
.
# Prior SVC thrombus. Continued warfarin with appropriate INR
checks.  INR elevated on day of discharge.  Rec holding coumadin
for 2d
.
# Systemic lupus erythematosus: cont home prednisone dose
.
# Dispo status: ambulating, pain free, BP in the 150/90 range
