47 yo M with history of epilepsy admitted for elective vagal
nerve stimulator replacement, transferred to MICU for management
of tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia, found to have
pericardial effusion, now s/p pericardiocentiesis with drain in
place, transferred to CCU for post-operative monitoring, with
frequent agitation, now found to have bilateral PEs
.
# Pericardial effusion:  In the MICU, pt noted to be tachycardic
with hypotension, and found to have pericardial effusion.  He
underwent pericardiocentesis with drain placement with drainage
of bloody fluid.  Hct stable despite profuse bloody drainage.
Etiology is likely malignancy given that CT torso showing RUL
lung spiculated nodule. Effusion cytology and micro showed cells
c/w metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.  Drain was eventually pulled
without complication and without any further hemodynamic
instability.  Pulsus checked for several days after drain pulled
and resolved effusion on Echo, was ~8 mmHg on discharge.
.
# PE/DVT:  Pt noted to have enlarged RV on repeat echo [**1-31**], so
CTA was obtained for concern of PEs which confirmed b/l
subsegmental PEs.  LENIs also positive for b/l DVTs.  He was
started on heparin ggt in house and transitioned to an
anticoagulation regimen of coumadin, with a lovenox bridge.  He
will f/u with his PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**] [**2-12**] after discharge.
.
#  Agitation: Patient with history of EtOH, marijuana,
cocaine/crack binges. He was significantly agitated throughout
admission which was initially thought to be secondary to ETOH
withdrawal.  He was maintained on a valium CIWA and klonipin 1mg
TID.  However, agitation persisted despite being well out of the
acute withdrawal window.  He had several code purples called for
him and was often violent towards nurses. Of note, pt would be
lucid and engaging often during the day with decompensation at
night.  Psych was consulted who felt that this was less likely
to be withdrawal and instead a behavioral issue/delerium, likely
in setting of supratherapeutic valproate level.  They
recommended haldol for his agitation which was continued 5mg PRN
along with 10mg QHS standing, these were discontinued on
discharge, takes no psych meds at home and delirium apparently
cleared.  Evaluated by psychiatry prior to discharge, appeared
to understand importance of f/u.  He was started on MVI,
thiamine, folate.
.
# Afib with RVR: Patient oscillates between HR of 70s ?????? 170s
with frequent episodes of RVR on tele, asymptomatic. Based on
old records, has a history of Afib with RVR, a flutter, was
treated with diltiazem and flecainide, and was supposed to be on
Metoprolol.  Increased metoprolol to 75 mg po qid standing which
has controlled rate well, though still with frequent episodes of
rapid ventricular response that respond to IV lopressor 5 mg x
1.  Because of continued episodes of RVR (likely in the setting
of pericardial effusion and multiple PEs) pt started on
diltiazem drip, weaned off and started on diltiazem ER 120 mg
daily, and metoprolol changed to 200 mg of metoprolol succinate
on discharge.  HR in the 60s with these changes, with short
bursts of SVT to 130s prior to discharge.  Would consider
uptitrating rate control as an outpatient.
.
#. h/o epilepsy and seizure activity: VNS placed and was
re-activated about 1 week after placement.  He was continued
home AEDs.   Depakote ER 1250/1500/1500 and Oxcarbazepine 600 mg
[**Hospital1 **] which was often given IV due to inability to take POs from
agitation.  Depakote level was found to be elevated in setting
of delirium, however unclear if this was true trough.  Was
discharged on home meds and advised to f/u with his outpatient
neurologist for management of his depakote.
.
# Foley self-d/c:  Pt pulled own foley overnight [**1-30**].  Of note
there was blood around the uerethral meatus after he pulled it.
Urine output was monitored and foley ended up being replaced on
[**2-2**] given that he was put back into 4pt restraints.  Foley
dc'ed and was able to void on his own with no hematuria for
remaineder of admission.
