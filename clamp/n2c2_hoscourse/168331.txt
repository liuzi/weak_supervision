A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50yo man w/ rapidly progressing ALS who is
status post tracheostomy, PEG, IVC filter placement with course
complicated by peptic ulcer cauterization, and antibiotic
treatment for S. aureus and B. fragilis bacteremia.
.
#Respiratory failure:
The pt initially presented from home [**2187-8-3**] w/ chronic
complaints of weakness, difficulty eating, and intermittent
shortness of breath. At the time on the medical floor he had
worsening secretions in his oropharynx requiring nasotracheal
and oropharyngeal secretions with distress resulting in
hypertension and tachycardia. A Scopolamine patch was placed and
pt was admitted to the MICU on [**2187-8-8**] for more intensive
monitoring and nursing care. He subsequently recovered, was
extubated, and was called out to the floor on [**2187-8-10**].
.
The patient's respiratory status remained stable until late
night on [**8-21**]. The pt had a sudden onset of SOB with
diaphoresis, followed by hypotension. The MICU team was called.
The pt's vitals at midnight were T 96.1, BP 154/80, HR 100, RR
26, O2 83% on 2L NC. At this point the pt was placed on NRB.
During this period the pt's family was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding his
code status. He had been DNI only until the day prior when the
pt and his family decided to allow for intubation for scheduled
PEG placement [**8-22**]. Given this reversal of code status,
clarification was warranted. Initially the pt's wife/hcp could
not be reached. At 12:15 am the pt's vitals were BP 86/66, HR
70, RR 16. ABG was done and showed 7.04/121/138. The pt was
placed on peripheral dopamine and given an amp of HCO3. A CXR
was performed and did not show any acute pulmonary process. An
EKG was without acute changes. The pt's wife was reached and
affirmed that the pt was to be full code. The pt was intubated
at around 12:30 am for hypercarbic respiratory failure. His
dopamine was discontinued as his pressure stabilized. He was
further supported hemodynamically with IVF boluses (1.5 L) prior
to arriving to the ICU. In ICU a R IJ TLC was placed and pt was
bolused to maintain pressures.
.
In the ICU, pt was stable and multiple attempts to wean him for
extubation, but he was unable to maintain ventilatory status on
his own. After much discussion with the family in conjunction
with the palliative care team, the decision was made to place
tracheostomy and gastric tube.  After trach placement, attempts
were made to place him on trach collar which he was only able to
tolerate for short periods. He was fitted for a Passy-Muir Valve
to allow him to speak with the trach. He has some endotracheal
secretions for which he is treated with glycopyrrolate.  He is
currently vented with Vt 600 cc Respiratory rate: 14 PEEP: 5
cm/h2o FIO2: 40 % which he tolerates well.
.
#GI bleed: He was initially guaiac negative during his
hospitalization. Pt's hematocrit dropped to 17 on [**2187-9-9**]. A
abdominal CT was performed that showed no RP bleed but
high-density material in the stomach, concerning for gastric
hemorrhage.  We attempted to draw a residual through his PEG,
but it was obstructed, unable to infuse or withdraw. Hemolysis
labs were not revealing. His stools then became guaiac positive
during this time period. GI was consulted and performed an EGD
which showed an ulceration at the PEG tube site that was
cauterized. Surgery was consulted to reassess the PEG tube, and
it was cleared with sodium bicarbonate tablet solution.  He was
maintained on [**Hospital1 **] PPI. Anticoagulation was stopped and a
retrievable IVC filter was placed on [**2187-9-11**]. His Hct was
subsequently stable. He received a total of 5U PRBC for this
bleed. Throughout hospitalization PEG worked without difficulty.
.
#Tachycardia: Pt was tachycardic throughout stay. TSH wnl. Pain
and anxiety were adressed with psych consult and starting
mirtazapine in addition to his home sertraline. He denied any
pain that might be contributing. He had an echocardiogram which
showed hyperdynamic LV function. In discussion with cardiology,
we believe that his tachycardia may result from autonomic
instability resulting from his ALS. During the remainder of his
hospitalization, his heart rate was controlled with low-dose
metoprolol.
.
#Bacteremia: Pt has been afebrile. WBC stable. Follow-up
cultures are negative to date.  Completed 14-day course of
vancomycin for coag-negative S. aureus, levofloxacin and
metronidazole for B. fragilis.
.
#h/o DVT: Pt had wafarin and heparin doses adjusted depending on
his antibiotic regimen and OR status. He was maintained on low
dose wafarin while on levofloxacin and metronidazole. All
anticoagulation was stopped on [**2187-9-9**] with his GI bleed. A
retrievable IVC filter was placed on [**2187-9-11**].
.
#Elevated troponin: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a troponin leak at the time of
intubation peaking at 1.4. He had no EKG changes without a bump
in his CK, so he likely had a reversible ischemic event in the
context of sepsis, tachycardia, and intubation.  He denied any
CP at the time. His troponins trended down thereafter.
.
#ARF: During this hospitalization, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an acute
increase in his creatinine despite good UO. Renal U/S ([**2187-8-27**])
was negative for hydronephrosis. His UA showed urine
eosinophils. His creatinine increase corresponded to his
starting Zosyn, so Zosyn was stopped with slow resolution of his
creatinine to baseline.
.
#Disposition: Mr. [**Known lastname 50219**] health is stable and transferred to
Radius [**Hospital 7755**] Hospital.
