In brief, the patient is a 71 yo male with history of coccygeal
fracture, and CAD, who presented with back pain of 2 weeks
duration, found to have a T7-T8 epidural mass on MRI. He
subsequently was found to have a MSSA osteomyelolitis, underwent
colpectomy and fusion, however his course was complicated by
post-op NSTEMI, bradycardic arrest (complete heart block), upper
extremity venous clot, and delerium.
.
## Epidural Mass:
Patient presented with back pain of increasing severity of 2
weeks duration, that he rated as [**9-26**] on admission. Patient had
decreased patellar reflexes but no other focal neurological
deficits, and back was non-tender to palpation. No leg weakness,
sensory deficits or bowel/bladder incontinence.  MRI on
admission showed an epidural mass at T7-T8 level with some
moderate cord compression.  CT spine confirmed this finding.
Found to have elevated ESR to 102 and CRP of 216 concerning for
infectious process. Based on imaging the differential of the
epidural mass was infection (bacterial abscess vs tuburculoma),
vs malignancy vs AV malformation. The patient denied any history
or exposure to TB, however he was in North [**Country 480**] in the [**2044**]'s
during the Korean war. Recalled one episode of walking
pneumonia, nearly 20 years ago, was not hospitalized. Recalls no
episodes of hemoptysis. The patient denied any history of
malignancy, however he has not seen a physician in many years.
Given the possibility of infection he was started on
broad-spectrum abx including Ceftriaxone, vancomycin and flagyl
IV.  He was afebrile.  Ortho spine followed the patient and he
was provided with a TLSO brace given his T7 collapse.  Serial
neurological exams were performed looking for signs of cord
compression and were normal.  On [**12-3**] the patient underwent
CT-guided biopsy of the mass and tissue was sent to microbiology
 and pathology.  Gram stain and culture returned positive for
GPC.  ID was consulted for further recommendations.  When
organisms were identified as Staph aureus the ceftriaxone and
flagyl were discontinued.  He was continued on vancomycin with
goal troughs 17-20.  When sensitivities returned MSSA the
vancomycin was switched to Nafcillin 2gm IV q4h.
.
ID recommended TTE given epidural abscess and murmur on exam
(unclear age given no regular medical care).  TTE showed no
evidence of endocarditis with no vegetations or abscesses.  A
TEE was not performed given the patient would require a long
course of antibiotics and TEE would not change the management.
A PPD was also placed given tuburculoma was in the differential
and was negative.  Additionally, AFB smear and stain were both
negative.  AFB culture is pending.  There was no evidence of
granulomas on CXR or chest CT suggestive of old TB infection.
.
Although the patient appeared to have an MSSA abscess, an
underlying process could not be excluded.  Given possibility for
underlying malignancy an SPEP/UPEP were sent. PSA was 1.0 and
chest CT showed no lung nodules. Path of epidural biopsy showed
inflammation. Given the location of the abscess and involvement
of T7-T8 vertebrae with T7 collapse, the patient was taken to
the OR for surgical spine debridement/stabilization by ortho
spine. He underwent two surgical procedures to debride and
stabilize his spine (please see op notes from [**12-10**] and [**12-13**]
for details).  He should complete a 6 week course of nafcillin
to end on [**2101-1-20**].  He has follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic on
[**2101-1-5**] and may need lifelong suppressive therapy.
.
## NTEMI - Two days after his second surgery, the patient
developed chest pain.  An EKG revealed lateral ST depressions.
The pain was relieved by nitroglycerine complicated by mild
hypotension.  His cardiac enzymes were positive with a troponin
T peak of 0.27. His CPK-MB was also mildly elevated to 12.  He
was conservatively managed particularly with regard to his
recent spine surgery.  His cardiac regimen was adjusted to
include aspirin, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and Imdur.
.
## Cardiac arrest - The patient's course was further complicated
by a bradycardic arrest leading to asystole.  This episode was
not captured on telemetry. He received CPR as his DNR status had
temporarily been changed peri-operative.  He was resuscitated
successfully without use of epinephrine, atropine, or
electricity.  He was initially stabilized after transfer to the
CCU but had a similar arrest twice the next morning each
following repositioning. Telemetry revealed complete heartblock.
 An externalized pacemaker was placed with a screw-in lead in
the RV as putting a permanent pacer in while the osteomyelitis
was being treated.  The bradycardia appears to have been
triggered by excessive vagal tone.  The day before discharge a
perm. pacemaker was placed and was interrogated by EP and found
to be working well.  He has follow up on [**2101-1-5**] with the
device clinic to further evaluate the pacer.
.
## Anemia: Patient was found to be anemic on admission.  No
baseline for comparison.  Fe studies suggestive of anemia of
chronic disease.  Patient reports no hemoptysis,
hematemesis,melena, or hematochezia. EBL from the surgery was
~500cc.  Late into his CCU stay, he developed guaiac positive
stool.  His Hct stabilized after transfusion.  He continued on a
PPI.  He can follow-up with his PCP for potential referral to GI
for colonoscopy as an outpatient.
.
## Delirium: The patient developed delirium attributed to
medications (narcotics and benzodiazepines), and disruption in
sleep-wake cycle and CCU psychosis.  He was found not to have
capacity to refuse life saving interventions.  His daughter
[**Name (NI) 2127**] [**Name (NI) 70073**] was appointed health care proxy.  The patient's
agitation was managed with nightly haldol with as needed haldol
as well.  Other sedating medications such as narcotics and
benzodiazepines should be avoided as much as possible. Once he
was transferred to the regular medical floor his delirium
improved and by discharge he no longer displayed any signs of
delirium.
.
## Constipation/diarrhea:  Patient had not had a bowel movement
in over a week when he presented.  He was started on an
aggressive bowel regimen given constipation and requirement of
large amount of narcotics.  This bowel regimen was weaned down
over the course of his hospital stay.  Since being on the
antibiotics, he has developed diarrhea and has a rectal tube in
place. The diarrhea could be from an infectious source vs. the
antibiotics themselves.  He was tested for C diff and found to
be negative x3.  A C diff B toxin has been sent and will be
followed up after discharge.
.
## Hypertension:  Patient has a history of hypertension but had
never been treated. BP was initially labile and elevated
readings seemed to correlate with pain.  When pain was better
controlled the patient's BP remained elevated with SBP 140-150
at times.  His blood pressure was controlled as above.
.
## Iliac artery dissections: Incidental finding on CT. Vascular
consult obtained. No evidence of peripheral vascular compromise.
 Vascular team recommended outpatient follow up in 6 months with
ultrasound.
.
## Upper Extremitiy DVT - The patient developed a clot in the
right cephalic vein in the setting of a RIJ central venous
catheter.  He was initially anticoagulated but this was held in
the setting of the GIB.  Warm compresses and arm elevation
should be used to limit propagation of the clot.  The patient
had a CTA of the chest that was negative for PE.
.
## Enterobacter in sputum - The patient did have a sputum
culture that revealed a pan-sensitive enterobacter cloacae.  He
did not have any clinical evidence of pneumonia (no fever,
normalizing WBC, no definitive consolidation on imaging).
Antibiotics, levofloxicin, directed at this bacteria were
started when he was noted to have an infiltrate on CXR and some
shortness of breath. He also developed a large pleural effusion
and underwent a thorocentesis.  The fluid was exudative and
likely related to the pneumonia although the gram stain was
negative (he has been on antibiotics).  The cytology is still
pending and should be followed up by his PCP.
.
## Elevated Creatinine - Creatinine was 1.6 on admission.
corrected following IVF.
.
## Prophylaxis: PPI, heparin converted to [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings and
pneumo-boots with slow GIB.
.
## FEN -Regular diet with 5x/day nutritional supplements with
ensure plus. Did have hypokalemia likely secondary to
medications and loose stools.  He will receive standing
potassium repletion and need potassium level checked shortly
after discharge to adjust the dose.
.
## CODE - DNR/DNI. patient's daughter [**Name (NI) 2127**] [**Name (NI) 70073**] was
appointed health care proxy during this admission.
.
## Dispo - discharged to rehab
