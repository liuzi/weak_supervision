87yo woman with history of coronary artery disease, congestive
heart failure, presenting with diaphoresis, melana, and found to
have upper GI bleed.  During her hospitalization, the following
problems were addressed:.
#.  GI bleed:  Patient was initially admitted to the ICU and
transfused three units PRBC.  Emergent EGD was done in the MICU
showing an ulcer at the GE junction, but it was too obscured by
blood for further investigation.  She was monitored overnight in
the MICU and then transferred to the floor.  She underwent
repeat EGD which showed two distal esophageal ulcers.  It was
later noted that the patient had been taking only a minimal
amount of water with her weekly Fosamax, and this was thought to
be the cause.  Fosamax was held until further discussion with
the patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], can be had.
Aspirin and Plavis were also held, and she was treated with big
iv Protonix.  Hct stabilized, and her diet was advanced.  She
was discharged to home on Prevacid 30mg [**Hospital1 **], liquid formula. She
will resume taking Plavix 75mg daily on [**2180-4-19**].  She was
instructed to resume Aspirin 81mg daily 4 weeks after discharge.
 She will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to review her hospital
course On [**2180-4-18**].  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
repeat endoscopy [**2180-6-8**], 8 weeks after initial
evaluation.
#.  Leg twitching:  On day two of her hospitalization the
patient began complaining of bilateral leg twitching.  A
neurology consult was called and found her exam to be consistent
with myoclonus due to metabolic insult.  Specifically they felt
the elevated urea level after her GI bleed likely resulted in
the muscle spasms.  Other sources of metabolic insult were
evaluated including tests for thyroid function, and were
nondiagnostic.  The neurology services believed it would resolve
spontaneously with clearance of the urea.  The remainder of her
neurologic exam was within normal limits.
#.  CAD:  There were no acute issues.  She was ruled out for
acute MI and continued on her outpatient regimen of captopril,
carvedilol, and statin for secondary prevention.  Plavix will be
restarted [**2180-4-19**], aspirin 4weeks after discharge..
#.  CRI:  Baseline creatinine 1.0-1.1, and was elevated as high
as 1.3 during her hospitalization.  It was thought to be
prerenal in etiology and treated with gentle iv fluids.
#.  Hypothyroid:  continued Synthroid per outpatient regimen.  A
TSH was checked and was mildly elevated at 4.4; however, free T4
was within normal limits at 1.6.
#.  Psych:  continued citalopram, trazadone per outpatient
regimen
#.  Osteoporosis:  We discontinued weekly Fosamax out of concern
that this was related to the developed of GE ulcers.  The
patient was instructed to discuss resuming Fosamax with her
primary care physician.
#.  Dispo:  The patient was discharged to home.  She has full
time home health aides.  Health care proxy is her daughter [**Name (NI) **]
