This is a [**Age over 90 **]yo F with h/o a fib s/p recent 2nd cardioversion on
[**5-5**], HTN, ? CAD s/p clean cath [**2127**], s/p recent femur fx, PNA
and cellulitis who p/w afib w/ RVR, persistent weakness,
lightheadedness, vertigo and DOE.
.
1. Afib w/ RVR. Pt. was admitted with presyncopal symptoms and
vertigo, likely from central hypoperfusion, though cerebellar
dysfunction could not be ruled out given positive romberg in
setting of intact proprioception.  She was HD stable on
admission and her INR was 3.6. Her Afib recurrence was felt to
be exacerbating CHF as evident on last TEE.  Patient was
restarted on Verapamil of 180mg, her BB was increased to 37.5mg
[**Hospital1 **] and her coumadin was held.  On HD#2, patient developed afib
with slow VR, chest pain, diaphoresis and nausea, her ECG was
unchanged and her CE were negative x1.  She subsequently
developed hypotension to mid 70s mmHgs, which did not respond to
IVF and required dopamine for HD stability.  She was temporarily
transferred to CCU where pressors were weaned within few hours
of arrival.  It was felt that her hypotension was secondary to
poor inotropy in setting of bradycardia from multiple nodal
blocking agents.  Throughout stay in CCU she was borderline
tachycardic and was eventually placed back on small dose of
lopressor for HR control. On HD#3 she was transferred to the
floor w/ HR of 100bpm and only on 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] of metoprolol.  She
remained HD stable and converted to atrial tachycardia vs. slow
aflutter.  Her BB was increased and she was started on low dose
digoxin without loading, 0.125 mg EOD.
.
On this regiment her HR was difficult to control.  She continued
to remain in Afib/flutter with HR in 100s despite 50mg TID of
BB, digoxin.  She was started on amiodarone and underwent
cardioversion on [**2140-5-24**].  This was successful, pt. was in sinus
rhythm.  Her BB was decreased to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] due to temporary
bradycardia to high 40s, digoxin was discontinued and amiodarone
decreased to 200mg [**Hospital1 **].  With this regimen, HR maintained in
50s, her DOE improved significantly and her lightheadedness and
dizziness resolved.  On [**5-25**] at ~ 11pm patient was noted be
unable to speak.  Her neurological deficits included R facial
droop and eye lid muscle weakness.  Code stroke was called, CT
head showed a L distal MCA stroke in insular region.  No tPA was
administered due to INR of 2.9. Her INR became supratherapeutic
with INR 3.9 on her day of discharge hence Coumadin is held for
now.  It needs to be restarted at 1mg once daily once INR <3.0
and needs daily monitoring until stable.  Dosing may need to go
up once Amiodarone dosing decreases to daily dosing on [**6-2**].
Also, patient should be started on lisinopril for heart
protection on [**6-2**].
.
2. CAD - Pt. had h/o CAD with no h/o MI, CABG or PCI.  She had a
clean cath in [**2127**]. Based on above PMHx it was not suspected
that she had flow limiting CAD, especially with no elevation of
CEs in setting of cardiogenic shock.  She ruled out for MI.  She
was continued on BB as above.
.
3. Systolic CHF.  Pt. had a nl EF in [**2127**] Echo, but no other
imaging except a TEE, where it was noted that she had mild
systolic dysfunction.  TTE here prior to hypotensive episode
showed global vertricular dysfunction w/ EF of 20-25%  Given
lack of significant CAD, this was felt to be most likely
tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy and treatment was focused on
HR control.  Pt. was volume overloaded on exam, likely
contributed by the tachycardia and poor filling.  She was
continued on home dose of lasix. She was started on ACE-I,
Lisinopril 5mg daily, however due to renal failure, Cr. 1.5 this
was discontinued.  Her lasix was held on [**5-26**].  This should be
restarted within a day as tolerated by volume status, likely
[**5-27**] (home lasix dose of 40mg PO).
.
4. Acute on Chronic RF: Cr on admission up to 1.3 Likely due
decreased CO w/ LV CHF in setting of afib.  Cr recovered to 1.1,
near baseline after complications with hypotension, however
bumpted back up s/p cardioversion in setting of receiving extra
10mg IV lasix.  Cr improved to 1.2 on [**5-26**].  Her lasix is
currently being held.
.
5. Left MCA infarct in the setting of therapeutic INR: Most
likely cardioembolic given the risk factor and patient returned
to Afib rhythm from sinus after cardioversion.  Pt was not a
thrombolytic or endovascular therapy candidate due to high INR
hence high bleeding risk.  Patient was transferred to the
neurology service on [**5-26**] and MRI showed that she has acute
superior division of L MCA infarct (precentral gyrus) but not a
large infarct hence safe for anticoagulation.

Patient remains unable to speak, but can make vocalizations, and
is able to swallow. She has mild R facial droop with weakness,
more in the arm than leg.  Physical and occupational therapy
recommended acute rehab.
