Assessment and Plan: 88 yo male with pmh of metastatic colon
cancer and hypertension who is being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to
hypotension and need for continued intubation s/p ERCP attempt
for biliary obstruction.
.
# Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive after intubation on
propofol. Likely secondary to propofol, however also in the
differential is hypotension from sepsis. He has two potential
sources for sepsis: biliary obstruction and recent apsiration.
Also could have volume depletion. Since coming to the floor his
pressures had recovered and phenylephrine weaned off. Given the
possibility of sepsis, he was started on vancomycin, flagyl and
cefepime, but then changed to ceftriaxone and flagyl.  The
vancomycin was discontinued after the cultures were negative x
48 horus.  On the day before discharge he was transitioned to PO
levofloxacin to complete a full course through [**11-11**], cultures no
growth to date at discharge.
.
# Biliary obstruction/obstructive jaundice: The patient
underwent a CT at the OSH which showed intrahepatic and
extrahepatic bile duct dilatation likely due to a metastasis to
the pancreatic head from his colon cancer. He failed ERCP due to
external compression of the duodenum limiting their ability to
pass the scope.  A duodenal stent was placed by the ERCP team to
help to decompress the gastric outlet obstruction.  Given the
failed ERCP attempt, IR was consulted and performed an IR guided
biliary drain on [**2199-11-6**].  He was transferred to the floor and
his LFTs trended down after the stent was placed.  His drain was
clamped on [**11-8**] and with continued improvement of his liver
tests and symptoms.  He was discharged with a clamped biliary
drain to follow up with interventional radiology.  If symptoms
return, the drain can be unclamped to a bag.
.
# Respiratory distress: The patient presented to the ICU
intubated since the ERCP. On the following morning he was
successfully extubated and breathing appropriately on room air.
.
# Anemia, chronic disease: The patient was noted to have
coffe-ground regurgitation during the ERCP procdure. He was
anemic with a Hct of 26 at the OSH and 25 on admission labs
here. Vit B12 and folate normal at the OSH. Fe low, but other Fe
studies not sent. Haptoglobin high makes hemolysis unlikely.
Most likely due to anemia of chronic disease and possibly due to
oncologic treatment. Started an IV PPI due to concern for coffee
ground regurgitant.  His hematocrits were stable and did not
need transfusions.
.
# Metastatic colon cancer: Patient has multiple mets seen on OSH
imaging. He will follow up with his outpatient surgeon after
discharge.
.
# Hypertension, benign: stable
