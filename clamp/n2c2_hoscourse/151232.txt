1. Dyspnea:  she was admitted w/ dyspnea in setting of URI
symptoms that was most consistent w/ viral URI, as there was no
fever and no infiltrative process on chest CT.  She was tested
for influenza w/ DFA of nasal aspirate.  Meanwhile, she was
treated w/ ceftriaxone and azithromycin to cover possible CAP.
On HD#2, DFA returned as positive for influenza A.  As the pt
had been afebrile w/ no signs of infxn, pneumonia was thought to
be unlikely and abx were d/c at that time.  She remained dyspnic
w/ upper and lower airway wheezing throughout her early hospital
course, which was thought to be [**2-6**] viral bronchitis.  She was
treated w/ prednisone taper and nebulized albuterol and
atrovent, w/ good symptom control.  However, she required
continued O2 by NC to maintain O2 sats >93% throughout the first
half of her admission.  By d/c, she was weaned off O2 and was
breathing comfortably on room air without requirement for
albuterol or atrovent.  At d/c, she is maintaining good O2 sat
on room air and is not dyspnic.

2. GI bleed:  she was observed to have melanic stool in the ED,
without any GI symptoms.  She was guaiac positive at that time.
This was most likely [**2-6**] indolent upper GI bleed.  On admission,
coumadin was held and heparin was started for anticoagulation
given her AVR.  Treatment was started w/ IV protonix.  Plans
were made for EGD/colonoscopy to evaluate for source of
bleeding, but these procedures were delayed due to the pt's
dyspnea and relative risk of sedation.  Her HCT was observed to
drop significantly, which was likely [**2-6**] retroperitoneal bleed
as below, and not related to GI bleed.  After her admission, she
had no further melena or hematochezia.  After stabilization of
retroperitoneal bleed, she underwent EGD and colonoscopy, which
demonstrated evidence of esophagitis w/ no active bleeding.
Protonix was changed to oral formulation, and sucralfate was
added for improved treatment of esophagitis.  She had no further
evidence of active GI bleeding during her admission.  Her
sucralfate was stopped. She will need to continue protonix twice
daily after d/c.

3. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage:  on HD#4, her HCT was observed to
have dropped overnight from 27 to 21.  This was concerning for
active GI bleed.  She was transfused w/ 2units PRBCs, w/
appropriate HCT increase to 29 after transfusion.  However, her
HCT again decreased overnight from 29 to 22 with no melena or
hematochezia to explain the blood loss.  Lab workup showed no
evidence of hemolysis.  Abd CT demonstrated large left
retroperitoneal hemorrhage, 11x5 cm in size, w/ radiographic
evidence of acute on chronic bleeding.  Heparin was d/c, she was
transfused w/ an additional 2units PRBCs, and was transferred to
the MICU for close monitoring.  Surgery was consulted, and
recommended holding anticoagulation with close monitoring of
HCT.  The pt had appropriate response of HCT w/ PRBC
transfusion, and HCT remained stable for 3 days off
anticoagulation.  As HCT had stabilized, she was transferred
back to the Medicine floor and Surgery recommended resuming
heparin for anticoagulation.  Heparin was resumed w/ close
monitoring of PTT, and HCT was monitored closely.  However,
after resuming heparin the pt had another decrease in HCT
concerning for active bleeding.  Heparin was stopped
immediately.  Repeat CT scan showed enlarging left
retroperitoneal bleed tracking down into pelvis and left thigh.
CTA was done to localize source of bleed, and showed active
contrast extravasation from the left L3 lumbar artery.  IR was
consulted, and performed embolization of left L3 lumbar artery,
though there was no evidence of active bleeding from the artery
at the time of the procedure.  She tolerated the procedure well.
 HCT was follow closely after embolization, and remained stable
for 3 days.  Repeat CTA showed no active bleeding from the L3
lumbar artery, which indicated a successful embolization.  Given
this confirmation and stable HCT, heparin was resumed w/ initial
goal PTT of 40.  HCT was stable on this level of heparin, so
heparin was increased to goal PTT of 60-70.  The pt received 1
dose of coumadin 5mg to begin long-term anticoagulation.  A PTT
of 60 was achieved and was stable for 12 hours w/ stable HCT,
but the pt then developed abdominal distention and pain, w/
significant LLQ/LUQ tenderness on exam.  This was concerning for
additional bleeding.  Heparin was once again d/c, and repeat CT
showed markedly enlarged retroperitoneal bleed displacing the
left kidney and bowels to the right abdomen.  Surgery, IR, and
Vascular Surgery were all consulted for recommendations on how
to stop her bleeding.  The consulting services all agreed that
intervention was ill-advised, as surgical treatment was often
inneffective and repeated arterial embolization in this setting
might result in embolization of the wrong vessel, w/ possible
bowel infarction or other complication.  Thus, the pt was given
2units FFP to reverse her INR of 1.3, and was transfused w/
2units of PRBCs.  Her HCT did not respond appropriately to PRBC
transfusion, so she was transferred to the MICU for close
monitoring and continued transfusion.  While in MICU,
anticoagulation continued to be held, and patient remained
stable during MICU course.  Indeed, it was felt that risks of
bleeding outweighed need to anti-coagulation benefits. The
patient was transferred to the floor with no further episodes of
bleeding and a stable hematocrit for >72 hours by discharge.

4. HTN:  BP was acceptable on admission.  BP meds were held
initially given concern for GI bleed and subsequent
retroperitoneal hemorrhage.  However, BP was elevated within a
few days of admission.  When retroperitoneal bleed had initially
stabilized, her outpt meds were resumed including diovan, HCTZ,
and clonidine, resulting in good BP control.  When her
hematocrit began to drop for a second time and the patient was
transferred back to the MICU, her antihypertensives were again
held. As her bleed stabilized, her blood pressures trended
upward and she was restarted on diovan at 1/2 her home dose. Her
blood pressures should be followed at rehab.

5. Anemia:  she has h/o iron deficiency anemia, w/ prior EGD
showing gastritis.  HCT on admission was slightly below baseline
of 32-33.  HCT remained stable for initial hospital days, but
dropped w/ retroperitoneal bleed as above.  Her HCT was labile
throughout her admission [**2-6**] intermittent bleeding. At d/c,
there is no evidence of active bleeding.  She will require f/u
of HCT after d/c to watch for further bleeding.

6. Hypothyroidism:  stable on synthroid during her admission.

7. AVR:  she has St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] artificial aortic valve; requires
anticoagulation w/ goal INR 2.5-3.5.  INR subtherapeutic on
admission.  Given melanic stool, we held coumadin on admission
and started heparin for anticoagulation.  She had intermittent
retroperitoneal bleeding during her admission, requiring d/c and
resumption of heparin multiple times as above.  Given her
repeated spontaneous bleeding after embolization of L3 lumber
artery, we do not want to restart anticoagulation in the near
future as the risk of ongoing bleeding is too great.

8. Mediastinal LAD:  she has mediastinal LAD, w/ largest node 3
x 2 cm by CT.  This may represent lung CA given pulm nodule and
smoking history.  However, the pt wishes to defer further
evaluation until active issues resolved.  Will follow w/ repeat
CT 2 months after d/c.

9. Cystitis:  she developed cystitis from yeast while using
foley catheter, likely [**2-6**] [**Female First Name (un) 564**], as supported by pyuria and
yeast in ucx.  Foley catheter was changed on discovery of yeast
in urine, and she was treated w/ 7 day course of fluconazole.
At d/c, there is no evidence of active infection.
