A/P:
64yo man with h/o TIIDM, CAD, Afib, and Gout, presenting  with
myositis vs rhabdomyalysis, transferred now with tachypnea and
hypercapnia and acidemia.
.
#  Respiratory failure  Poor ventilation due to progressive
muscle weakness.  Rising PCO2 and respiratory acidemia
progressed to hypercarbic respiratory failure.  No evidence of
primary pulmonary process.
-  Pt intubated for worsening ventilation/oxygenation in setting
of worsening weakness
-  Remained intubated due to poor NIFs.  Very brief SBT failed
when pt had no respiratory effort.
-Given continued poor respiratory muscle strength, likelihood of
lengthy intubation, percutaneous tracheostomy performed on
[**2133-9-1**] and trach placed.  Complicated trach placement due to
subcutaneous emphysema on same day of trach placement.  Incision
site was widened and subcutaneous emphysema and swelling
decreased over the next two days.  No pneumothorax or
pneumomediastinum seen on CXR.
.
#  Myospathy:  rhabdomyolysis/myopathy, pathololgy from muscle
biopsy suggests myopathic changes, possibly drug-induced.
Rheumatology and neurology consulted.  Not thought that steroids
will help this disease process.  Off statins, will follow CK and
clinical picture, await gradual recovery.
.
#  ARF:  contrast nephropathy, ATN on chronic diabetic
nephrophathy.  patient briefly anuric.  Hemodialyzed, but now
with improving renal function, increased urine output, no
further need for dialysis at this time.
.
#  Transaminitis:  LFTs returned to NL; likely due to rhabdo.
hepatitis serologies negative.  CTA abdomen nondiagnostic
.
#  Foot wound:  patient completed 10days Linezolid per podiatry
recc's.  Podiatry following.
.
#  TIIDM: RISS + NPH for elevated blood sugars.
.
#  HTN:  metoprolol
.
#  FEN:  diabetic, cardiac diet; PEG placed on [**9-8**]
.
#  PPx:  SC heparin, po diet
.
#  Access:  PICC
