82yo F with h/o PUD and CKD with recent acute renal failure from
hydralazine induced pauci-immune glomerulonephritis admitted
with BRBPR and atrial fibrillation with RVR.
.
# GIB: Given significant orthostasis, hct down to 24 (baseline
30) and history of PUD, initially concerned about UGIB.  NG
lavage was negative which was reassuring.  She was given 2u pRBC
with stable blood counts and hemodynamics.  She had an EGD on
[**4-13**] without e/o active bleeding.  Per GI likely LGIB and will
need c-scope sometime during this admission.  She was also given
2u FFP given coagulopathy and concern for GIB and need for
endoscopy. Bleeding ceased, however, colonoscopy deferred
secondary to difficult to control AFib with RVR. She should
follow-up as an outpatient for colonscopy.
.
# AF with RVR: She had been on sotolol for several years until
her recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] when this was discontinued in the
setting of her worsening renal failure.  She was noted to have
AF with RVR to 140s.  Initially felt to be worsened by volume
depletion with GIB.  However, despite blood products, she
remained tachycardic and thus nodal agents were resumed.
Anticoagulation was held in acute setting, with coagulopathy
reversed in the setting of GIB. She was uptitrated on her PO
regimen to Metoprolol 50mg TID and Diltiazem 30mg QID which kept
her HR in reasonable control until she underwent a bowel prep
for her colonoscopy. On the morning of the scheduled
colonoscopy, she developed AFib with RVR in the setting of
dehydration evidence by alkalosis and hypernatremia. She
received agressive IV hydration and multiple IV medications to
help control rate. Her heart rate initially responded and
stabilized in the 90-100's. However, the following evening, she
required another bowel prep and her heart rate escalated to the
150's. She received additional IV nodal agents and her PO
regimen was increased. An electrophysiology consult was obtained
and the recommendation was for rate control and uptitration with
her current medications. Rhythm control was deferred. She was
restarted on anti-coagulation on HD#5 with a heparin gtt. A TEE
showed no evidence of thrombus. A cardioversion was attempted
and was unsuccessful. The patient was loaded with amiodarone and
the Metoprolol was uptitrated to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] to achieve adequate
rate control. She was started on Diltiazem which was uptitrated
to 45mg PO QID.  HR was in the 80s on discharge.  Her coumadin
was re-started and heparin gtt was continued until the INR was
therapeutic.  Her INR became supratherapeutic and Coumadin was
held on discharge.  She should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.  She should have INR checked in 2 days and coumadin
restarted.  If her Amiodarone converts her to sinus rhythm or
drops her heart rate as she becomes therapeutic, she may need to
stop her Metoprolol.
.
# CHF: In the setting of Atrial Fibrillation with RVR, the
patient was noted to develop signs and symptoms concerning for
CHF, such as rales and O2 requirement. The patient was diuresed
adequately with Lasix and symptoms improved. The patient was
weaned off supplemental oxygen and was staturating 95% on RA.
Her creatinine bumped and Lasix was stopped.  Her peak
creatinine was 2.8 on [**2182-4-21**] and came down to 2.5 on [**2182-4-23**].
Lasix can be considered as an outpatient if she develops signs
and symptoms of congestive heart failure.
.
# CKD: Renal function improving.  Per renal, taper prednsione to
40 mg and then to 30mg. She remained on prednisone 3omg Daily
and her creatinine remained stable.  Her steroid ppx including
PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **], PPI, calcium, vit D were continued.  She was followed
by the renal consult service during her admission and Lasix was
held when Creatinine was elevated.  She is on Atovaquone
Suspension 1500 mg PO/NG DAILY for prophylaxis.
.
There are no pending studies at the time of discharge.
