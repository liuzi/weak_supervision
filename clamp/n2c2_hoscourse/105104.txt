66yo M w/ unrelated PMH presented to OSH, found to have
pancytopenia w/ blasts in smear, transferred and found to have
AML on flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy.
.
# AML: Patient was admitted and found to be pancytopenic but
asymptomatic except a chronic non-productive cough that was
attributed to seasonal allergies. He underwent TTE which showed
normal LVEF. He underwent bone marrow biopsy on [**7-14**] which
confirmed diagnosis of AML. A triple lumen subclavian CVL was
placed on [**7-14**]. He was started on 7+3 induction therapy on [**7-14**].
He tolerated the infusion well and his ANC fell to 0 on [**7-22**]. He
was thrombocytopenic and developed gingival bleeding with PLT in
the 30s and was transfused as needed. He was also anemic and
transfused as needed. Repeat bone marrow showed
hypercellularity. Patient was started on MEC therapy and
tolerated it well. His ANC remained 0. Repeat bone marrow on D14
of MEC showed hypocellularity. His counts gradually increased
and antibiotics were discontinued, he had been on broad coverage
with vancomycin, cefepime, and ambisome (spent a lot of time in
[**State 15946**]) and remained on these antibiotics until he was no
longer neutropenic or febrile.  Counts continued to increase and
at the time of discharge pt was no longer neutropenic and WBC
was 4.1.  Bone marrow biopsy on [**2158-8-28**] showed no clonal
cytogenetic aberrations and <5% blasts.  However, skin biopsy
for a purple-pink papular rash on both forearms with biopsy was
consistent with leukemia cutis.  Considering his bone marrow
response and the resolution of this rash, it was thought to be
rseolved.  He will followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for futher
treatment.
.
# Febrile Neutropenia: As counts decreased, the patient was
febrile without obvious source in urine or lungs and was started
on cefepime and vancomycin and levofloxacin which had been
prescribed for cough was discontinued. Given the concern for
hemorrhoids and possible minor anal mucosal tear, see below,
Flagyl was added. Micafungin was added on day 4 after first
spike given continued fevers. Pt. felt well and was ambulatory,
taking PO during this time. Patient clinically improved, but
then developed high fevers, rigors, and whole-body rash,
respiratory distress (see ICU course below). He was pan-scanned
again, and CT sinus showed sinusitis. Coccidio, beta-glucan,
galactmannan, histoplasmosis, legionella, blood fungal cultures
were sent and were all eventually negative. ID was consulted and
suggested removing cefepime and micafungin as they might cause
rash. He was placed on vancomycin, meropenem, and ambisome (for
aspergillus and coccidiomycosis coverage). Patient had risen
LFTs which eventually trended down. He improved clinically and
antibiotic coverage was stopped on [**8-26**] when patient had been
afebrile for several days and ANC >1000.  Beta glucan from [**8-26**]
was >500.  ID was consulted again and advised to recheck beta
glucan, as it may have been an erroneous result, since he was
asymptomatic and had stable lesions on chest CT from [**8-26**], and
also requested a mycoF/lytic culture.  These results are to be
followed up as an outpatient and no antifungal coverage or
liver/spleen imaging were advised unlses the he spiked a fever,
which he did not do.
.
# Guaiac positive stool: Patient reported hard and painful BM
during induction therapy. Bloody streaks were seen on stool,
minimal blood in toilet. Platelets transfused, Hct stable. Bowel
regimen increased and further BMs were guaiac neg and soft for
the rest of his hospital course.

#hematuria: noted to have hematuria [**8-15**] in the setting of
thrombocytopenia.  CT abd/pelvis showed mild R hydronephrosis
and proximal-mid hydroureter on [**8-15**].  Hematuria resolved as
thrombocytopenia resolved, platelets were transfused for <10.
F/u ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis in the setting of
increasing creatinine, urology was consulted concerning the
hydronephrosis and advised that he follow up as an outpatient
for a hematuria workup.
.
#Thrombocytopenia: pt had low platelets as expected and was
transfused PRN for platelets <10.  On [**8-20**], had urticarial
reaction to crossmatched platelets that improved with tylenol,
PRA assay positive.  Thrombocytopenia improved without
intervention as the rest of counts went up as well.

#Acute kidney injury: Patient's creatinine was elevated starting
[**8-24**] from baseilne of 0.9 to 1.8 on [**8-29**] despite removal of
nephrotoxic vancomycin and ambisome on [**8-26**].  Renal was
consulted and considering FeNa of 2.1, was thought to be due to
AIN, although it is unclear which medication caused this.  He
did have a drug rash earlier in his hospital course, thought to
be related to micafungin or meropenem, but it is unclear what
caused the AIN.  He will followup with renal service as an
outpatient.

#L 4th and 5th finger numbness: Patient had noted this
consistently for a week and mentioned it on [**2158-8-24**].  MRI T and
C spine and brachail plexus were ordered to eval for CNS spread
of disease, in addition LP was done.  No lesions on MRI and no
evidence of CNS disease.  Numbness may be [**12-27**] ulnar neuropathy,
he will follow up in neurology clinic and may get an EMG.
.
ICU Course ([**Date range (1) 29638**])
Hypoxia: Pt with increased O2 demand and some respiratory
distress which lead to his brief transfer from the onc service
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Pt was initially given nebs, changed from NC to
facemask, and given IV lasix. He was redosed with lasix with
good urine output. CXR showed no change and ECHO was obtained.
Pt O2 requirement stabilized and he was titrated down to lower
dose nasal cannula.
.
Febrile Neutropenia: Temp of 101.4 at time of ICU transfer.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were continued but elevated LFTs
raised concern over the administration of fluconazole. Because
of the pts significant travel history to some fungal endemic
regions it was determined to treat emperically with Ambisome so
this was started and Fluconazole D/Ced. Near the end of the
first Ambisome infusion pt spiked a fever above 104 and had
chills/rigors. This calmed down with demerol and tylenol and was
thought likely due to the infusion vs an infectious cause.
.
Pancytopenia: This was thought [**12-27**] to AML and chemo with Hgb low
on ICU presentation. Over brief ICU course 1 unit of PRBC was
initially given followed by 2 units PRBC the next day. Pt had
mild temp at time of beginning of the 2nd transfusion but it was
administered in spite of this. Hct responded appropriately to
these infusions.
