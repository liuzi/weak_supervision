Ms [**Known lastname 101562**] was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery service on the
day of her scheduled surgery, [**2115-5-15**]. INR was checked that day
(1.2). She underwent left video assisted thoracoscopic surgery
with pericardial window under Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The surgery was
uneventful and went as planned, but she remained intubated
overnight given her very high oxygen requirement. She was
transferred to the ICU intubated and an urgent pulmonology
consult was requested. Our pulmonology colleagues agreed with us
that she was retaining fluid leading to pulmonary edema so we
removed all IV fluid and began diuresis with furosemide IV. She
responded well and she was extubated in the afternoon of POD 1.
By POD 2, she had resumed most of her home medications and was
beginning a regular diet. Her Coumadin was resumed and
pericardial drain was removed (total output ) on POD 3. She
remained in the ICU until POD 4, the primary indication being
increased oxygen demand, requiring face tent most of the day.
Chest x-rays and daily weights indicated she was no longer fluid
overloaded, but her oxygenation continued to be poor. On the
floor, we were unable to keep her oxygen saturation above 90%
with less than 4L nasal canula. She reports this as her baseline
pulmonary status, though denies being on home oxygen. She was
seen and evaluated by physical therapy who initially recommended
rehab due to risk of fall. She also required 4L NC desaturating
to 84% on 2L NC. Over the next few days she improved.  Physical
therapy re-evaluated her and deemed her safe for home with PT.

While in house some mild confusion which improved over the
course of her hospital stay.  On discharge she was awake, alert,
oriented and walked independently.
