This is a 61 yom with hx of HTN and COPD who initially presented
to the ED c/o SOB and noted to be massively fluid overloaded, in
ARF with hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, with transaminitis and
synthetic dysfunction who was then admitted to the MICU for
altered mental status and eventually intubated for respiratory
distress and fluid overload.

# Acute on Chronic Liver Failure:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with
total body fluid overload.  He had a transaminitis which
improved and worsened several times throughout his hospital
stay.  He had synthetic dysfunction of the liver manifested by
thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.  All of these findings were
consistent with cirrhosis.  A CT scan on admission confirmed a
nodular liver.  He slowly developed worsening liver failure
during his hospitalization.  A liver biopsy was done on [**2124-12-21**]
which confirmed cirrhosis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and
were negative for Hep B and Hep C.  Hep A antibody was positive.
 Hepatology was consulted and cirrhosis was thought to be [**3-6**]
history of EtOH abuse.  Tranaminitis in the hospital was unclear
but possibly [**3-6**] shock liver in the setting of hypotension.  INR
continued to rise and peaked to a level of 27 today.  Family was
involved and a family meeting was held today given his
worsensing liver failure and shock which was requiring 4
pressors.  He was made CMO by his father, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], and the
patient passed away peacefully today at 225pm.

# Hypoxic respiratory failure/Pneumonia:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
initially intubated for respiraroty distress in the setting of
hypoxemia [**3-6**] fluid overload.  He was treated with diuretics
with minimal urine output.  Renal was consulted and he was
diagnosed with Hepatorenal syndrome and required dialysis for
fluid removal.  He was placed on HD with good removal of fluid
intitially. WBC then began to elevate and CXR was consistent
with Pneumonia so he was started on Vanco/Zosyn/Levo for
treament of hospital acquired pneumonia.  He completed a 7 day
course for his PNA.  He self extubated while in the MICU and was
then reintubated for respiratory distress.  He then developed
VAP while intubated and was treated with Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro.

# Shock:  Patient had acute decompensated liver failure along
with pneumonia which were likely contributing to his shock.
Broead infectious workup was done and workup remained negative
while in the hospital.  He was treated with Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro
for treatment of HAP.  Flagyl was started out of concern for
c.diff although c.diff cultures remained negative.

# Altered mental status: Thought to be secondary to hepatic
encephalopathy.  Initially improved with lactulose.  Patient was
treated with lactulose and rifaximin throughout his stay.

# Acute Renal Failure:  Thought to be [**3-6**] hepatorenal syndrome.
He developed anuria while in the hospital.  Given his fluid
overload and pulmonary edema requiring intubation, renal was
consulted and a dialysis line was placed.  He was placed on HD
for removal of fluid.  This was changed to CVVH when he became
hypotensive to allow for gentle fluid removal.

# Hyponatremia: Thought to be [**3-6**] fluid overload in the setting
of cirrhosis

# Coagulopathy: Likley [**3-6**] cirrhosis and liver failure
