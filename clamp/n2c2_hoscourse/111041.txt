Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent redo sternotomy repair of
pseudoaneurysm involving the distal ascending aorta with bovine
pericardial patch using deep
hypothermic circulatory arrest. For surgical details, please see
the operative note. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. He was transfused
with PRBC's to maintain a hematocrit near 30%. He remained in
the CVICU for aggressive bronchial hygiene and tenuous pulmonary
status with baseline COPD. He maintained stable hemodynamics and
was transferred to the step down unit on postoperative day two.
Physical therapy was consulted for evaluation of his strength
and mobility. He became acutely confused on POD#3. This
confusion was felt to be related to Ativan which was discontined
and within 24-48 hrs his confusion had resolved. Also on POD#3
serous sternal drainage was noted on his sternal wound without
any erythema or sternal click. He was placed on emperic
antibiotic coverage. He remained afebrile with stable white
blood counts and without any sign of infection. He remained in a
normal sinus rhythm.  He had an pleural air leak
postoperatively, however chest tubes and pacing wires were
removed without incident. He remained in the hospital for
extended period due to continued drainage and on post-operative
day eight this drainage had resolved and he was discharged with
ten days of Keflex to Newbridge on the [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation
Center.
