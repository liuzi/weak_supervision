As noted in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted in the trauma bay to
have bilateral mangled extremities.  He also had an absent
radial pulse on the left side prompting vascular surgery
involvement.  He was noted to have extensively mangled bilateral
upper extremities as well as a left buttock soft tissue injury
that did not appear to track to bone.  Orthopedics, plastics and
vascular surgery were consulted in addition to the acute care
surgery team and he was taken to the OR directly from the trauma
bay.
.
Please refer to the individual operative summaries from the
various teams providing care from [**2191-6-24**] for specific details
but, in brief, vascular surgery performed a thrombectomy of the
left brachial artery with primary repair of arteriotomy after
initial debridement and washout by ACS and orthopedics.  The
wounds were wrapped and a vac was applied to the buttock wound.
He was taken to the Trauma ICU postoperatively.
.
Patient underwent one more debridement surgery on [**2191-6-28**] and
then and initial reconstructive surgery of bilateral upper
extremities with skin grafts and integra on [**2191-7-5**].
.
Patient's mental status improved after ICU stay and he was alert
and able to carry on conversations with staff.  At times he was
A+Ox3 but at other times confused.  He is able to recall the dog
attack.  Geriatric team felt fluctuations in mental status were
multifactorial and related to trauma, de-conditioning, ICU stay,
sleep deprivation, pain medications.  They felt that this would
gradually improve over time and with supportive care.
.
Neuro: He was intubated and sedated in the immediate
post-operative period and for several days while in the TICU.
He was on fentanyl and propofol for pain control and sedation
during this time.  When he was awake and extubated, his pain was
controlled with IV dilaudid for dressing changes and oxycodone
for complaints of pain in between.
.
Cardiovascular: He did not require vasopressors in the
post-operative period.  He was hemodynamically stable.  He did
have a history of paroxysmal afib but was in normal sinus
rhythym for most of his admission.  His coumadin was held during
this admission and he was prophylactically anticoagulated with
once daily lovenox injections.
.
Heme: Patient required multiple blood product transfusions
during his ICU stay due to loss of blood at the scene of the
attack and subsequently due to oozing open wounds. Geriatrics
was consulted for help with managing patient once he was
transferred to the floor and onto Plastics surgery service.
Geriatrics recommended starting patient on thiamine, folate and
MVI for h/o heavy EtOH and persistent anemia post-traumatic
event and subsequent surgeries.
.
Resp: Initially, he was intubated with an ETT on MMV and CMV,
eventually weaned to CPAP and then successfully extubated on
[**2191-6-30**].  Patient continued to improve his respiratory status
post extubation.  On hospital day #19, there was a question as
to whether patient may have aspirated after a meal when his head
of bed was lowered.  Patient was encouraged to cough and deep
breathe and his vital signs/O2 sats remained stable.  He was
ordered for albuterol nebulizer treatments PRN for wheezes.
.
GI/nutrition: In the post-operative period, he had an OGT placed
and was started on tube feeds under the guidance of Nutrition.
Patient received isosource 1.5 with a goal rate of 60 cc/hr.  He
tolerated these well.  When patient was awake and alert, Speech
and Swallowing was consulted to assess the patient's safety
eating different consistencies of foods and liquids.  A video
swallow revealed evidence of some aspiration of thin liquids so
patient was placed on soft/ground diet which he tolerated well.
Patient self d/c'd his Dobhoff tube and it was not replaced due
to ability to take POs.  Patient required 1:1 assistance with
all of his meals and snacks.  Patient with cumulative
nutritional deficit due to events related to trauma and
reconstruction.  Albumin 2.3 from initial albumin of 2.9.
Snacks and supplemental puddings were encouraged.
.
Renal: He had a foley catheter and maintained good urine output.
 His creatinine was elevated on admission and trended down to
1.4 at discharge.  His electrolytes were repleted PRN. He was
given lasix/albumin to assist with his edema on HD 5.  Patient's
foley was maintained for inpatient stay due to inability to
utilize a urinal manually d/t bilateral upper extremity injuries
and dressings.
.
ID: He was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics,
vanc/zosyn/clinda.  Infectious Disease was consulted on [**2191-6-25**]
to help with antibiotic guidance and postexposure rabies
vaccinations.  Patient received Rabies Immune Globulin 1650 UNIT
IM ONCE within 24-hours of arrival and then Rabies vaccine on
days 1, 3, 7 and 14. The clindamycin was dc'd on [**2191-6-28**] due to
lessened concern for a necrotizing soft tissue infection.  Blood
cultures were negative.  A tissue sample obtained in the OR from
left elbow grew VRE so Vancomycin was discontinued and patient
was maintained on zosyn IV until [**2191-7-11**].  Patient remained
negative C.difficele despite multiple loose stools/day.
.
Prophylaxis: Patient was maintained on Lovenox 40 mg QD for DVT
prophylaxis and wore pneumo boots while in bed.  He was assisted
in and out of bed to chair when he was able to tolerate
transfers.  Patient was assisted to use his incentive
spirometer.
.
TLD: He had a right groin CVL placed during the initial trauma
evaluation.  This was removed in the OR and he had a right IJ
CVL placed which remained in place until day of discharge to
rehab when it was removed.
.
At the time of discharge on hospital day #19, the patient was
doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a soft
mechanical diet and supervised thin liquids, getting out of bed
to chair with mechanical lift, foley catheter draining clear
yellow urine, and pain was well controlled.  Bilateral upper
extremities (BUE) with skin grafts and integra in place to wound
without evidence of infection or breakdown.  BUEs with daily
dressing changes with xeroform, gauze fluffs, kerlix and ace
wraps.  Left forearm/hand with custom orthoplast splint in
place.  Wound vac dressing intact and patent to left posterior
buttock/flank wound (last vac change [**7-11**]).  Bilateral thigh
skin graft donor sites with original xeroform dressings in place
and left open to air to dry.  Left lower medial calf wound with
dry dressing in place.
