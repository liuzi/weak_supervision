68M thyroid ca to bone + liver p/w increased pain L shoulder/
humerus.  Pt was admitted to the Medicine service and treated
for the following problems:
.
# pneumonia: Patient had altered MS and low grade fevers [**1-22**]
and CXR performed which suggested pna. Started on levo/flagyl
with concern for aspiration. [**1-23**], patient had new hypoxia and
hemoptysis. Hematocrit has remained stable. CTA negative for PE
but did confirm significant pneumonia.  No fevers since starting
levo/flagyl.
.
#L shoulder/humerus pain: Evaluated by radiation oncology who
felt that risks of radiation in setting of multiple prior
episodes was quite high especially given instability.
Neurosurgery consulted for cervical spine.  His pain was
initially difficult to control, but was ultimately dramatically
improved when he was changed to a dilaudid PCA--he did not have
relief from fentanyl patch, likely b/c of soft tissue wasting
and future efforts at long acting medications should be PO.
.
#thyroid ca, metastatic disease:  progressive in spine and
likely contributing to current complaints.  Levothyroxine was
continued. consider neupogen. Will d/w attending Oncologist
.
# thrush: The patient was admitted with thrush which was
succesfully treated with nystatin S&S.

Neurosurgery team asked to eval this pt on [**2153-1-23**]  and was
transferred to our service for spinal deformity which was noted
on upper level of images (CT chest) to r/o PE.  CT of cervical
thoracic spine was obtained and results of T1 collapse noted.
Pts family, at that time wanted to continue care with prior
Neurosurgeon/Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**].  This was communicated to this
neurosurgery team.  Some short time later the family wished
against transfer out to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1334**] care and decided that they
would want surgery to correct spinal deformity/kyphosis here.
The pt was placed in [**Last Name (un) 20482**] Halo traction at 30lbs of traction.
This was in attempt to reduce kyphotic deformity for
pre-operative optimization.  A CT scan of the spine was obtained
in traction and good reduction of the deformity was noted.  The
pt was then medically optimized and pre-op'd and taken to the OR
on [**2153-2-8**] for C7 T1 T2 corpectomies/ anterior approach. There
was a lot of bleeding during the initial anterior approach / the
case lasting approximately 7 hours.  It was decided that the pt
would remain intubated and return to the OR on the 5th (the next
day for continuation of the case.  The second portion of the
case was completed that day (the 5th).  Thoracic surgery
assisted because of mediastinal mass / we needed sternotomy to
control bleeding and complete ant. approach. The total EBL was
7.5 liters with the pt being given 22 units of PRBC's.  He had a
chest tube placed on the left side intraoperatively.  This was
removed on approx 1/7/7.  Postoperatively he was started on
Fondiparinox on [**2-13**] as he is HIT positive. On [**2153-2-14**] he had a
peg tube place. His postoperative  head CT and spine CT's were
stable.  His neurological status postoperatively was stable. All
extremeties are antigravity and his mentation is intact.  His
course complicated by intermittent low HCT's for which he was
transfused.  Temps as high as 102.+ for which he was started on
Zosyn. On [**2153-2-16**] his left upper extremity was noted to be
swollen and son[**Name (NI) **] noted LUE DVT.  On the 14th, the halo ring
that was initially placed for use of cervical traction and for
potential halo vest placement was removed.  He remains in a
cervical collar and had been OOB to chair.  The patient required
prolonged ventilation he had difficulty clearing his secretions.
 His family was offered a trach but they felt the patient had a
difficult post operative course and was suffering they did not
want to the patient to under go further procedures.  The patient
had made his wishes clear to his family not to be dependent or
on a ventilator for a prolonged period.  After a long discussion
with the family and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] they decided to extubate the
patient and see if he could tolerate being extubated, he quickly
passed away in a few minutes with his family at his side.
