This is a 51 year-old Female with a stage IV breast cancer with
mets to liver who was admitted to ACS on [**2122-7-13**] with a port line
infection which was subsequently removed on [**2122-7-13**]. Initial
blood cultures grew MSSA and Enterococcus and she was started on
Vancomycin. She was then transferred to the medicine service on
[**2122-7-20**] for bacteremia management and progressive dyspnea. She
received a TEE on [**2122-7-21**] that was negative for vegetations.
Chest imaging revealed bilateral loculated pleural effusions
prompting left VATS and chest tube placement on [**2122-7-21**] with the
pleural fluid growing MSSA. Her shortness of breath progressed
and she required up to 4L NC. She had a CTA on [**2122-7-23**] that did
not reveal central or lobar PE, but segmental/subsegmental PE
could not be ruled out. She was briefly started on heparin, but
this was discontinued due to persistent right sided empyema as
leading cause of hypoxia. Her antibiotic coverage was broadened
to Vancomycin and Zosyn the night of [**2122-7-23**]. Blood cultures
negative since [**2122-7-17**], left sided pleural fluid growing MSSA.
.
She subsequently had right sided VATS with chest tube placement
on [**2122-7-24**]. The pleural fluid demonstrated frank purulence.
During the procedure the patient required Levophed support and
in the PACU, SBP remained in 80's, MAPs 60's despite 2L LR.
Phenylephrine gtt was started, which was switched to Levophed
gtt. She received IV dilaudid for pain control.
.
Upon evaluation in the PACU, she was lethargic, awaking to
voice, but with poor attention and not answering questions
coherently, intermittently moaning in pain. Respirations were
unlabored and an ABG obtained prior to transfer was 7.38/42/164.
She was transfered to the MICU with 5 chest tubes in place and
requiring pressor support. The patient continued IV antibiotic
treatment with vancomycin.
.
The patient was transferred back to the medicine floor on [**7-27**]
from the MICU. The patient was briefly transitioned to Nafcillin
on [**7-31**]; however, subsequent blood work revealed [**Last Name (un) **] and likely
AIN, with Cr plateauing at 1.9, up from her baseline of 1.1-1.4.
This prompted the patient's return to Vancomycin.

In brief, the summary of the patient's active issues at
discharge:

51F with metastatic stage IV breast CA admitted to ACS for
port-line infection with subsequent removal of line, found to
have MSSA/Enterococcal bacteremia, and development of B/L
empyemas s/p multiple chest tubes who required MICU admission
for hypotension, previously on pressors.
.
# Fluid balance - The patient's hypotension resolved shortly
before transfer to the floor on [**2122-7-27**]. Her BP has been stable
on the medicine floor, with SBPs ranging from 120s to 140s.
During the patient's stay in the hospital, she became gradually
more edematous, with upper and lower extremity anasarca. Pt's
Albumin was noted to be at 2. Pt developed [**Last Name (un) **] with CR 1.9 after
lasix diuresis and nafcillin induction on [**8-31**]. Eos in urine on
[**7-31**], since resolved, prompted concern for AIN. The patient has
been transitioned back to Vancomycin, and her renal function has
been stable. The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on
Vancomycin. Per our renal consult, we started the patient on [**Hospital1 **]
albumin (25g IV) chased one hour after with 10mg lasix. This
promoted successful diuresis, and the patient has been stable on
this regimen.

# BILATERAL EMPYEMAS, CHEST TUBES, DYSPNEA - Pt was noted to
have increasing dyspnea, and bilateral pleural effusions were
noted on [**2122-7-19**]. CT confirmed the presence of loculated pleural
effusions. Pt is s/p bilateral VATS on the left side [**2122-7-21**] and
the right side on [**2122-7-24**]. Pt received b/l drainage and pleural
biopsy. 2 chest tubes were placed on the left side [**2122-7-21**] amd 3
were placed on the right side [**2122-7-24**]. The last chest tube was
successfully removed on [**2122-7-29**], and subsequent CXR has shown no
return of effusions with notmal lung spaces. Cultures from
empyemas were positive for MSSA. Pt's dyspnea resolved s/p VATS.

*Atypical epithelial cells recovered from VATS suspicious for
malignancy.
- Thoracic surgery recs - F/u as outpatient, appointment made
for [**2122-8-13**].
Pt's pain has been effectively controlled with Dilaudid PO 4 mg
Q4H PRN; oxycodone 20 mg PO BID. Pt has been relatively pain
free with only ocasional need for the Dilaudid.
.
# Port infection - PT was admitted for a port infection on
[**2122-7-13**] to acute care surgery. She had her port removed, with the
area debrided. Wet to dry dressings have been applied to the
surgical site, with marked improvement of the wound. There has
been no return of purulence since surgery, and her penrose drain
was removed [**2122-7-15**]. The wound shows evidence of good granulation
tissue. Cultures from the infected port grew MSSA.

# ANEMIA - evidence of downward trending hematocrit is likely
due to worsening chronic disease. Pt has been consistently
guaiac negative, and a hemolytic work-up was negative for
hemolysis. At time of discharge, Pt's hematocrit is at 25. Since
returning from the ICU, pt has received 2 units of blood on
[**7-31**], with hematocrit stable at 25 since.

# METASTATIC BREAST CANCER - faslodex 500mg IM was given to the
patient on [**2122-8-3**]. Her next dose is due on [**2122-8-31**].
Atypical epithelial cells suspicious for malignancy were present
in tissue taken from pleural empyema. B/L empyemas may have had
a malignant component.
.
# CONSTIPATION - Pt initially constipated, but has been stable
on current bowel regimen of docusate, miralax, bisacodyl, and
senna.

# ANXIETY - Pt has complained of anxiety, but has been stable on
Lorazepam 1 mg PO Q8hrs for anxiety.
.
# FEN: Regular diet with supplementation of carnation instant
breakfast in between meals for added nutrition.

# PPX: HSQ, SCDs
# ACCESS: PICC (changed [**7-28**])
# CODE: FULL
# DISPO: to [**Hospital1 **]
