66 RHM with PMH significant for HTN, AF (on warfarin), s/p
defibrillator/pacemaker (for ? bradycardia) CAD s/p 2 stents,
prior stroke (initially with left sided weakness but no residual
deficit) presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] with right sided
weakness (arm>face>leg) and dysarthria. CT revealed a left basal
ganglia IPH and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2104-12-29**]. Given
the presence of the IPH, his warfarin was reversed and stopped.
Patient was initially admitted to the ICU given significant
hypertension requirinng an IV nicardipine infusion. He was
transferred to the floor on [**2104-12-30**]. CTA was stable and no
significant aneurysm was identified. Although the most likely
cause for his IPH is hypertension, it was not possible to do an
MRI to look for an underlying lesion given pacemaker. Aspirin
should be started in 1 week and he will not be continued on
warfarin. He was transferred to rehab on [**2104-12-31**] and has
neurology follow-up. He should have a repeat CT head with and
without contrast prior to his follow-up to assess for the
presence of an underlying mass lesion.

# Neuro: Patient had a previous stroke as above with no residual
deficits and presented with right face, arm and leg weakness in
the setting of some mild neck pain but no clear headache on
[**2104-12-29**]. At OSH he was found to have a left basal ganglia
hemorrhage. He was given 10 mg of Vitamin K for an INR of 2.6
(no FFP was given) and Labetalol 20 mg IV for a SBP in the 170s.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. At
[**Hospital1 18**] ED, he received Profilinine (activated factor IX) and
received 2 units FFP later for INR 2.3. Examination revealed
right hemiparesis and right facial droop with dysarthria but no
aphasia, neglect or visual field defect. He was started on a
Nicardipine infusion for SBP up to 200s and was admitted to the
neuro ICU.

His head CTs remained stable showing no extension of the bleed.
CTA showed an old infarct in the left anterior basal ganglia
extending into the corona radiata with ex vacuo dilatation of
the left lateral ventricle in addition to multiple chronic
lacunar infarcts in the right caudate and lentiform nuclei and
angiography demonstrated a less than 2-mm sized aneurysm arising
from the left ICA bifurcation.

Stroke risk factors were assessed with HbA1c 5.4% and FLP
revealed Cholesterol 240 TGCs 111 HDL 41 LDL 177. CEs were
negative. He was initially monitored with glucose fingersticks
and this was stopped after several normal readings. He was
therefore started on atorvastatin 40mg daily and his fasting
lipids should be repeated in 3 months.

He continued to receive daily vitamin K until [**2104-12-30**] and INR
on [**2104-12-31**] was 1.0. He passed bedside swallow evaluation and
was placed on a regular diet. He slowly improved and was
transferred to the neurology floor on [**2104-12-30**]. We held all
antiplatelets and aspirin 325mg should be started in 1 week. We
stopped warfarin due to his hemorrhage. We were unable to obtain
an MRI given the patient's pacemaker and he will therefore need
a repeat CT scan with contrast to evaluate any possible
malignancy underlying the hemorrhage before his neurology
appointment.

The most likely cause of his hemorrhage is a hypertensive bleed
although his hypertension was controlled previously. As above we
will evaluate with interval scan to look for an underlying
lesion which may have bled.

His weakness was slowly improving at the time of discharge. He
was stable and BP was controlled on his home medications. He was
assessed by PT and deemed to benefit from rehab. He was
therefore transferred to rehab on [**2104-12-31**].
.
# CVS: BP was initially uncontrolled and was markely
hypertensive requiring IV meds and ICU admission. This was
latterly controlled and BP on discharge was SBP 120s-130s. He
was briefly hypotensive in the setting IV nicardipine and home
anti-hypertensives and this resolved before transfer to the
flor. We continued patient's home lisinopril and carvedilol.  We
monitored his INR daily and was 1.0 on discharge. Warfarin was
stopped and he should be restarted on aspirin 325mg daily in 1
week. Patient was started on atorvastatin 40mg daily as above
and should have repeat FLP in 3 months.
.
# Renal: Patient was admitted with Cr 1.3. He was not known to
have CRF. His Cr rose to 1.6 post-CT contrast on [**2104-12-31**]. This
should be repeated in 2 days time and then at least weekly.

TRANSITIONAL CARE  ISSUES:
Patient will need a repeat CT head scan with contrast as an
outpatient in [**4-24**] weeks from discharge. This has been requested.
Restart aspirin at 325mg daily in 1 week.
Please monitor Chem 7 as Cr rose from 1.3 to 1.6 following CT
contrast.
Repeat fasting lipids in 3 months.
