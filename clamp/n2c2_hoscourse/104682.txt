62 M h/o Hep C, HTN, depression on mult psych meds p/w altered
mental status/obtunded, rhabdo, fevers, and increased stiffness
after found down at home, transferred to us from [**Hospital1 487**] for
worsened fever, rigidity, CK. Had indications of rhabdo. His
mental status waxed and waned. Most likely was [**1-23**] NMS. Was
having continuous fevers and worsened obtundation. After gradual
improvement in mental status, he was transferred to the floor.
.
# Altered MS: Initially on admission he had an LP which showed
alot of RBC's. Differential was aseptic vs. blood tap vs.
subarachnoid blood from encephalitis / necrosis. He was placed
on CTX, Vanc, Amp, and acyclovir ([**9-14**]) and started cooling.
Neuro was following while he was in the ICU who believed this is
most likely due to NMS which might take about 14 days to
improve. He was treated with bromocriptine. EEE, West Nile
virus, lyme serology were sent. Lyme and RPR negative. MRI brain
showed mild to moderate cortical atrophy. His Parasite smear and
OSH cultures were negative. PICC line placed [**9-15**]. CSF HSV PCR
was negative and acyclovir subsequently was discontinued ([**9-18**])
along with the other antibiotics ([**9-17**]) given the low suspicion
of bacterial cause. EEG initially showed high epileptiform
activity and valium was started. Subsequent EEG monitoring
showed no seizure activity with gradual taper of valium and
discontinuation on [**9-18**]. On [**9-19**] he was more obtunded with
increased oxygen requirement. Therefore, CT and MRI head were
done which showed no acute changes. Vanc anc cefepime were
started on the same day to cover for presumed HAP given
increased oxygen requirement. CXR didn't show new infiltrates.
Abx dc'ed [**9-25**]. IV acyclovir was restarted [**9-20**] but dc'ed
Lactulose was initiated given concern of hepatic encephalopathy
in setting of HCV and elevated liver enzymes. RUQ ultrasound
showed cirrhosis with trace ascites. His mental status improved.
He received tube feeds starting from [**9-15**] and discontinued after
NG tube was self-removed by him on [**9-26**]. satting 92-93% on RA
while attempting to place an NG tube which eventually failed and
not pursued further. Tolerating apple sauce.
His mental status continued to improve.  Recommendation by
Neurology is to continue  bromocriptine  until [**2193-10-5**] and
continue Keppra for now.
Pt was started on Lactulose and should continue on this
titrating to 3BMs per day to avoid any component of hepatic
encephalopathy.
.
# Hypoxia
Continued oxygen requirement during his stay, but was satting in
90's on RA even during NG tube insertion multiple attempts on
his transfer day. stable. Cultures were have been unremarkable.
Large amounts of mucus were removed [**9-19**] with poor gag reflex.
Suspect due to secretions and AMS with poor cough.  He was
treated empirically for PNA.
This improved with improvement in mental status and has been off
oxygen prior to discharge.
.
# Transaminitis:
Persistently elevated AST and ALT. Evidence of cirrhosis on RUQ
US and CT. History of HepC. Continued laculose empirically for
hepatic encephalopathy.
.
# Hypernatremia
Resolved, likely due to poor access to free water.
.
# ARF/rhabdo: Initially Cr 3.0 on admission, ARF due to
rhabdomyolysis, CPK [**Numeric Identifier 24869**].  He received aggressive IVF hydration
with improvement in CPK and normalization of Cr to 0.7.
.
# HTN: Controlled on Labetalol 200 mg [**Hospital1 **];
.
# DM on insulin:
-on lantus and ISS
.
# Elevated Troponins:
Was not concerning for ACS.  Was in setting of ARF, elevated CK
w rhabdo, tachycardia. EKG sinus, normal int/axis, no st
changes.
.
Rehab Issues:
.
#Speech and Swallow recommendations:
1. PO diet: Thin liquids, pureed solids.
2. 1:1 supervision with POs.
3. One sip of liquid at a time.
4. Pills crushed with applesauce.
5. TID oral care.
6.  Keppra to be cut and given with applesauce.
.
#Psych recommendations:
-Would utilize behavioral means to reduce delirium (ie. maintain
light/dark cycles, frequent redirection).
-Would not initiate psychiatric medications at this time
(antipsychotics or antidepressants). At least two weeks should
be allowed to elapse after recovery from NMS before rechallenge
with a low-potency antipsychotic.
-In case of behavioral agitation, would refrain from use of
antipsychotic and instead utilize benzodiazepines (ie. Ativan)
or mechanical restraints (ie. posey, wrist restraints).
-Pt. should be followed by rehab psychiatrist, with followup
with outpatient treaters arranged.
