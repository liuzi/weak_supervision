ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 63 yo male with a h/o Type II DM,
CAD s/p 4v CABG [**2129**] and Ulcerative Colitis who p/w
fever/chills/NS/weight loss and enlarging peri-portal lymph
nodes on abdominal CT found to be positive for anaplastic T cell
lymphoma hospital course c/b NSTEMI and heart failure as well as
pneumonia.
.
PLAN:
# Lymphadenopathy/fevers: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for
accelerated workup of lymphoma given his history of fevers,
night sweats, and increasing lymphadenopathy.  The differential
on admission included infectious vs neoplastic vs. inflammatory
- constitutional symptoms and length of fevers point toward
neoplastic, but admitted with evidence of PNA and gallstones,
which are potential etiologies of infection.  The patient was
recently admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] where he had a negative HIV
test, negative PPD, and negative hepatitis panel.  A TEE was
also done to rule out endocarditis which showed no evidence of
vegetations.  In addition, blood cultures have all remained
negative.  On [**1-17**] a bone marrow biopsy was done given anemia
and lymphopenia.  The bone marrow bx was negative. Surgery was
consulted on admission as a 1.6cm peri-portal LN was noted on CT
and was the largest available for biopsy.  He had no palpable
lymph nodes on exam.  The bx showed anaplastic T cell lymphoma.
A pulmonary consult was also obtained for possible
transbronchial biopsy of lymph nodes on CT, but this was not
done since the bx was revealing.  SPEP was also sent and was
within normal limits.  He was started on cipro and flagyl given
PNA on chest CT and was shortly switched to Ceftriaxone and
azithromycin given persistent fevers.  Overnight on [**1-22**], he
desatted to 70s on 2L and required a nonrebreather.  CTA was
negative for PE, but showed a multilobar PNA.  Patient was 90%
on NRB, with one set of cardiac enzymes negative, EKG with
baseline ventricular ectopy.  He continued to have SOB and no
improvement in his sats the following morning and was
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency.
Second set of cardiac enzymes was positive for NSTEMI and he was
started on heparin gtt.  While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] several services were
consulted including ID, rheumatology, and cardiology.  He was
also diuresed aggressively.  He remained persistently febrile.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his oxygenation improved rapidly with supplemental
O2.  However, he continued to spike fevers despite adequate
antibiotic coverage for CAP.  He was placed in respiratory
isolation and a TB rule out was started.   He continued to spike
temperatures during this antibiotic course as well. The last Ct
chest looked better and antbiotics were stopped.
As the patient was ready to be transferred out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the
final pathology returned from pathology and showed anaplastic
lymphoma.  He was transferred back to the BMT service for
management.  The patient was initially treated with oral
prednisone and his fevers resolved. He was then tapered down on
the steroids and the fevers returned. This prompted starting
treatment for the lymphoma with CVP. Adriamycin was not given
because of the patient's heart failure. The patient did not have
any fever after starting treatment making it very clear that his
fevers were [**2-7**] lymphoma.
.
# NSTEMI:  H/o CABG in [**2129**] however recent negative stress test.
Upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], in the setting of SOB, cardiac
enzymes were drawn and patient ruled in for an NSTEMI.  An ECHO
was performed which showed worsened wall motion abnormalities
and overall worsened pump function.  Cardiology was consulted
who recommended aspirin, heparin drip, increased beta blocker
for tight HR control, 80 mg of QD statin, and diuresis as
patient had been fluid positive.   He was also transfused 2
units of PRBCs to obtain a Hct>30.  Patient's symptoms improved.
 Cardiology did not feel any need for intervention beyond
medical management unless patient were to have recurrent
symptoms and evidence of further ischemic evolution.  Once the
patient was transferred back to the BMT service, cardiology was
recalled to help [**Hospital Unit Name 4656**] the etiology of his heart failure.
They recommended a cardiac MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4656**] for an infiltrative
process in addition to continuing aggressive medical management.
A follow-up echocardiogram revealed improvement in EF back up
from 40% to 50%. During this stay, the patient had a fall and
developed a retroperitoneal bleed. ASA, plavix and sulfasalazine
were stopped and the patient was given at least 12 units of
PRBCs and 2 units of platelets. The patient remained
hemodynamically stable and was chest pain free. He will need to
follow-up with cardiology and eventually will at least need to
restart ASA after the bleed is resolved. The patient's liver
function tests were also elevated and lipitor was held. He is
currently on losartan and metoprolol. Spirinolactone was started
and stopped after 1 week as patient was hyponatremic.
.
# Hypoxia: Covered appropriately for CAP, atypical PNA and
healthcare-associated PNA.  He was continued on vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, azithromycin.  Blood cultures were negative
throughout.  Once back on the BMT service, a CXR was done which
showed a worsening infection despite antibiotic treatment.  Out
of concern that he was being inadequately treated Pulmonary was
recalled for evaluation of hypoxia and worsening infiltrate.
They felt that his hypoxia was due to decompensated CHF and that
the radiology would likely lag behind the treatment of
infection.  As the patient was improving clinically with
decreasing O2 sat requirement, they recommended completing the
course of antibiotics and continuing to diurese the patient.  A
bronchoscopy was considered to obtain more tissue, however, as
the patient had a recent NSTEMI, they felt that bronchoscopy
would be a high risk procedure and would be of low yield.  In
addition, the sleep medicine team came to [**Last Name (Titles) 4656**] the patient.
They did not feel that he was a candidate for a sleep study in
his present condition, however they recommended placing him on
2L O2 at night for presumptive sleep apnea.    On transfer to
BMT, his antibiotic regimen was Cefepime and Flagyl.  On [**1-30**]
the patient developed a rash which was likely related to
Cefepime.  His antibiotics were changed on [**1-31**] to levo/flagyl.
Flagyl was d/c'd after one week since no aspiration on video
swallow and levaquin was continued for another week. Patient did
not have an O2 requirement upon leaving the hospital. He was
several liters negative on 20mg IV lasix daily. The patient
continued to have lower extremity edema and likely needs further
diuresis. He was sent home on 40mg PO lasix daily with
instructions to monitor I/O's and daily weights. This dose may
need to be adjusted to optimize volume status.
.
# DM: Severe and uncontrolled at home, associated with
retinopathy, neuropathy, gastroparesis. Takes NPH in home
regimen (75 QAM, 30 QPM) but is not compliant with recent
admission for BG 900s. Last A1c 8.2 in [**8-9**]. He was continued on
NPH x qam, x qhs, and ISS with titration as needed to optimize
BG control.
.
# Ulcerative colitis: He was asymptomatic for GI complaints
throughout admission.  Thought unlikely to be causing fevers as
high as 103.  Sulfasalazine was discontinued when pt had RP
bleed. Should be restarted as outpt.
.
# Gastroparesis:  The patient suffered from frequent bouts of
retching for which he was taking reglan and a PPI.  Ativan
seemed to work the best for the patient.
.
# GERD: s/p Nissen fundoplication.  He was continued on
pantoprazole 40mg q24h
.
# Hyponatremia- patient persistently hyponatremic. This was
initially thought to be due to intravascular depletion and NS
was given. Patient was diuresed for volume overload and was
euvolemic. Urine lytes difficult to interpret given heavy lasix
doses. In the end it was thought that pt had SIADH given the
fact that his urine osm was 600-800. His thyroid and cortisol
levels were normal. He was put on fluid restriction, given lasix
to poison the tubule and demeclocycline and Na stabilized. It
was also thought that effexor was possibly causing hyponatremia,
so this was tapered off. The effexor can likely be restarted as
this does not seem to be causing the hyponatremia.  We also
discontinued spirinolactone as this can cause hyponatremia.
