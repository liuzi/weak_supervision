Fever: Blood culture and urine cultures were sent. CXR on
admission did not show focal infiltrate. He was started on vanco
(increased from chronic qod to qd) and zosyn (per discussion w/
ID). His recent hosp admission record [**7-26**] was reviewed and
showed extensive infectious workup which was unrevealing
(including MRI c-spine, which revealed no significant new
changes; neg bone scan; negative blood cultures; negative TEE).
GI and ID were concerned that his line (hickman placed in [**7-25**])
was the source of his fever. He has never had anything cultured
from the line and his cultures are again negative, though his
chronic vancomycin may be suppressing the organism. ID
recommended his home TPN be cultured (including M furfur).
Given negative cultures, the zosyn was discontinued and his
vancomycin was returned to [**Location **] dosing.  The patient remained
afebrile x 24 hours and was thus discharged home with
instructions to continue checking his temperature at least 2
times per day.

Hypotension-Pt was initially hypotensive to SBP 70s in the ED.
He responded quickly to a number of 500cc IVF boluses over the
initial 48 hrs. His BP meds were initially held.  He will
follow-up with his primary care doctor for a repeat blood
pressure check to consider restarting his lisinopril given his
history of MR.  His norvasc and lasix are also being held.

Hyperbilirubinemia/Elevated ALk Phos- His alk phos and bili were
elevated on admission (rest of his LFTs was relatively stable).
He did not complain of pain. RUQ u/s recommended by GI was
unremarkable.  Labs were improving at the time of discharge

Anemia-He has baseline anemia in the range of 35-37. His hct
slowly drifted down to low 30s on admission. Hemolysis labs were
sent but were normal.  Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic
disease.  Folate and B12 were normal.

Nutrition-Pt was initially given standard TPN as his home
formula was not available. Dr. [**Name (NI) 79**] (pt 's own GI specialist)
came by on [**8-25**] and gave specific instruction on the
non-standard TPN formulation.
