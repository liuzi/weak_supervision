This is the brief summary of this prolonged hospital course for
this pleasant 2-year old female who underwent a thoracoabdominal
aneurysm repair on [**2119-1-31**] complicated by post-op renal failure
due to TTP requiring plasmapheresis and hemodialysis, as well as
pulmonary and infectious complications. On day of discharge the
patient was tolerating a regular diet, comfortable,
hemodynamically stable, and requiring rehab placement for
ongoing dialysis.

On [**2119-1-31**] Ms. [**Known lastname **] went to the operating room where she
underwent a left thoracotomy and thoracoabdominal aneurysm
repair with a #26 gelweave graft (please see the operative note
of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for full details). On POD #1 she had decreased
urine output and ATN was noted, a renal artery scan showed
obstruction of flow for which she was taken back to the
operating room for an abdominal angiogram via open right CFA
(please see the operative note of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for full details).
Patent BL renal arterties with 50% stenosis were found. She was
seen in consultation by renal medicine who recommended dialysis,
which began on [**2119-2-2**]. Her platelet count was low at 66,000, a
HIT screen was negative. She also had some confusion
post-operatively , after extubation on post-op day 5. Hematology
was consulted and her findings were consistent with TTP. He
platelet counts improved with plasmapheresis and eventually
normalized.  She required intermittent neosynephrine and
nitroglycerine for BP management while on CVVHD, but eventually
was hemodynamically stable and restarted on lopressor as part of
her discharge regimen. Her renal failure improved and she was
able to make marginal urine (approximately 500 cc/day) prior to
discharge.

From a GI standpoint she was unable to tolerate a regular diet
initially after extubation. A bedside swallow evaluation on [**2-6**]
recomended continued tube feeds, but small amounts of pureed and
nectar thickened liquids with modifications. She was seen in
consultation by ENT and found to have vocal cord paralysis but
no immediate intervention was recommended. A Dobhoff tube was
placed for tube feeding, and eventually this was removed and a
regular diet was resumed. Nutrition consultation was obtained
and nutritional supplements such as Carnation instant breakfast
were recommended.

She had no major pulmonary issues post-operatively, but did
develop a left-sided pleural effusion. This was tapped for
approximately 1 liter on [**2119-2-20**] and she symptomatically did
better. She had no documented post-operative pneumonia.

From an infectious disease standpoint she had some fevers around
2 weeks post-operative. Full workup revealed only significant
yeast in her urine and she was treated appropriately with
Fluconazole. She also had empiric vancomycin around the
peri-operative period.

The patient worked with physical therapy and was able to
ambulate well with some assistance prior to discharge. Social
work services were obtained early in her hospital course and
case management assisted with finding appropriate
rehabilitation, as the patient originally is from [**State 108**].

The patient was discharged over 1 month post-operatively in
stable condition, tolerating a regular diet, ambulatory, with
good pain control, and normal cardio-pulmonary function. Her
major issues upon discharge included ongoing need for
hemodialysis, assistance with physical therapy, and assistance
with nutritional support. She has planned follow-up with Cardiac
Surgery. All questions were answered to her satisfaction upon
discharge.
