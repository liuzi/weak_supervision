45 yo male h/o DMT1, ESRD, on HD, presenting with hypertensive
urgency/emergency in setting of worst headache of his life.

# Headache: Given history the concern was for intracranial [**Doctor Last Name **]
initially. Head CT was without bleeding, and Head MRI/MRA/MRV
was without bleeding or vascular malformation or venous
thrombosis. Patient initially refused LP. Since his headache
persisted for four days without resolution and reported left eye
blurriness, and left eye pain. Neurology was consulted and they
thought the pain may be from a migraine or a vascular phenomenon
and less likely intracranial [**Doctor Last Name **]. They recommended an LP to
rule out [**Doctor Last Name **] or infection given his vague symptoms. Fioricet
was started to treat his headache. On day 5 of his
hospitalziation, his headache resolved, however 24 hours later
his headache returned during [**Doctor Last Name 2286**]. Given the non-specific
headache, an LP was performed after patient ultimately
consented. First attempt at bedside was unsuccessful. He
eventually underwent an LP under fluoroscopic guidance at
interventional radiology with CSF only notable for a mildy
elevated opening pressure of 27 cm H2O. He notably had only 1
wbc, 0 rbcs, and negative culture, Cryptoccocal Ag, EBV and HSV
viral PCRs.

 The headache persistently had an unclear etiology. The leading
differential was vasospasm vs. migraine vs. HTN vs. ?HD related
(since it was more prominent on HD days). It was decided to
discontinue his nifedipine and start verapamil, as verapamil is
more vasoactive; this medication would help vasospasm, migraine,
and HTN etiology.  His headaches persisted despite these
interventions. Pain was consulted and felt that dilaudid may be
helpful. It was felt that an injection would not be helpful,
given the diffuse nature of his headaches. Fioricet was
discontinued, as it did not appear to be effective any more. He
was continued on full dose verapamil and dilaudid prn. His HTN
medication was aggressively uptitrated with the thought this
this would help his headaches. This moderately controlled his
headaches. He also had severe nausea and vomiting that was
controlled with reglan, compazine, and zofran, which was also
thought to help his headaches. He was given a trial of high flow
oxygen as well in case the etiology was cluster headache, but
this was not successful.

 Of note, the patient was felt to be quite sensitive to opiates
and benzos. On the day of his IR guided LP, he received 1 mg of
IV Ativan, which decreased his RR to 8 and he appeared very
sleepy. He also received 4 mg IV morphine to help control his
HA, but he also developed decreased RR to 8 and the same
sleepiness. He was not given these medications any more.

 Since the etiology of his headache was unclear, it was felt
that placing the patient on a regimen that he could take at home
would be the best for him, rather than IV dilaudid. Pain was
re-consulted. He was started on low dose MS-contin [**Hospital1 **] and 25 mg
topomax [**Hospital1 **]. Approximately 36 hours after these medications were
started the patient was completely somnolent and responsive to
sternal rub only. He was given Narcan 0.4 mg approximately three
times over the course of his somnolence and woke up briefly. He
remained in this state for nearly 72 hours. It was felt the
patient was on too much sedating medication causing this
deleterious effect. All opiates, topomax, and gabapentin were
all d/c'd. He was given an extra day of HD in hopes that this
would clear some of the medication that has built up in his
system. He remained hemodynamically stable and protected his
airway. These medications should be re-started only if
absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. He was not given
any more sedating medication and only given standing tylenol,
1000 mg q 8H. Surprisingly, tylenol by itself appeared to
control his headaches in the days leading up to discharge. He
was headache free in the last 24 hours of his admission.

It is truly unclear what the cause of his headaches are. It is
still speculated that HD may be the cause, as small studies have
demonstrated HD may cause headaches. It is unclear what the
treatment for this is. Also, HTN headaches did not show a clear
pattern, it is striking how when his blood pressure is ideally
controlled, his headaches have cleared. Nevertheless, his
headaches have resolved for the time being and further follow-up
with his PCP is in order.

# Hypertension: His hypertension was most pronounced on
hemodialysis days with SBPs in the 200s frequently.  As a
result, his antihypertensive regimen was aggressively increased.
 He began to take all of his anti-hypertensives everyday of the
week, including on HD days. He continued to have very high blood
pressures after this regimen. His BP medications were increased
to maximal doses. A clonidine patch was added at 0.1 mg q
weekly. He continued to have episodes of sbp to the 200s
occuring after [**Hospital1 2286**] in the setting of a severe headache. He
was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring. His MICU
course was uneventful as his blood pressure decreased with IV
hydralazine x 1 and po labetalol, along with taking his BP
medications. He did not need an IV drip for blood pressure. He
was then started on Minoxidil 10 mg po BID. Near the end of his
hospitalization, his blood pressure was lower than expected with
levels in the low 100s. Minoxidil was decreased to 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]. It
was also noted that he was not wearing his clonidine patch for
several days in the setting of well controlled blood pressures.
After consultation with renal on the day of discharge, his
current regimen is as follows:
--Lisinopril 80 mg po daily (To be held the mornings prior to
HD)
--Valsartan 320 mg qhs
--Carvedilol 25 mg po BID
--Minoxidil 5 mg po BID (To be held the mornings prior to HD)
---Close follow up with his bp is highly recommended.

# Nausea/Vomiting: This was initially thought to be due to
gastroparesis, but a GES was performed which showed normal
motility. His N/V were felt to be secondary to his severe
headaches. His metoclopramide was continued, as was compazine
and zofran.   At times, despite these medications, he continued
to have nausea and vomiting. This proved quite difficult to
manage his blood pressure, as he would vomit his medication.
Once this was controlled, his blood pressure and headaches, and
eventually his nausea and vomiting improved. He was discharged
on metoclopramide 5 mg PO TID. Further evaluation of this
standing medication should be evaluated by his PCP at his next
visit.

# Cranial Nerve III Palsy: Diplopia was initially reported on
[**2-11**].  On further questioning the patient reports his symptoms
began on [**2-7**] after the ophtho exam.  Neuro initially evaluated
and feels likely third nerve palsy from diabetes.  LP negative
besides increased ICP of 27 mm Hg. Optho re-consulted [**2-18**] and
confirmed complete CN3 palsy as the cause of diplopia and
complete ptosis of left eye. It was felt that this may be
reversible, but if not, it can be surgically corrected. He will
follow up with Neuro-optho in the outpatient.

# DM1: continued home 75/25 plus HISS. He was given half his
standing dose when not tolerating PO.

# CKD: continued HD. Pt continued on sevelamer alone (phoslo
discontinued).

# Neuropathy: gabapentin was increased to TID initially, but
when patient became somnolent for several days, this medication
was discontinued. Of note, he was on a very high dose for HD
patients (300 mg TID). It was felt this may have contributed to
his somnolence. Caution should be made in the future if this
medication were to be re-started. He was continued on a
lidocaine patch for chronic left flank pain.

# Depression: During an episode of severe pain, the patient
stated he wanted to "kill himself." Since he has a history of
suicidal attempts, a 1:1 sitter was attempted. Through the
course of the day, growing concern that he would act on his
ideations by the sitter. Psychiatry was consulted and felt he
was not suicidal at this time, and the sitter was discontinued.
He was continued on citalopram. Social work actively consulted
the patient and helped him deal with his many social problems.
[**Name (NI) **] is to be followed with psychiatry in rehab.

# Low grade fever: A fever of 100.5 was noted during his
hospitalization. He was pan-cultured which was NGTD at time of
discharge. A chest x-ray did not show any acute finding. He was
not given antibiotics and his fevers resolved.

# Access: He had a right central line during this
hospitalization which was pulled prior to discharge. He has a
left AV fisula used for HD.
