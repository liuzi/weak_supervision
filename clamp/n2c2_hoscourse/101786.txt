64 y/o male with AML progressed from MDS currently being treated
with hydroxyurea who was admitted for a word finding difficulty
and was found to have a subdural bleed in the setting of
platelets of six.

1.)Subdural bleed -- The patient was initially brought up to a
platelet level of 50 and observed in the bone marrow unit.  On
the second day of admission, he experienced a sudden, severe
headache and had a stat head CT, showing no definite change in
the size of the lesion or the degree of midline shift, yet due
to his symptoms, neurosurgery was consulted.  They felt it
appropriate to take Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the OR where the subdural
bleed was drained; subsequent pathology demonstrated clotted
blood.  He was kept in the neurosurgical ICU for two days where
he did well with no post-operative complications and was then
sent back to the bone marrow unit for further care.  By his
return to BMT, his speech and confusion had greatly improved,
and his family members agreed that he was back to his baseline.
Throughout the remainder of the admission, he continued to
experience a slight headache, much improved from admission, that
was well relieved by 5mg of oxycodone.  His word-finding
symptoms did not recur.
The main challenge was maintaining his platelets at a an
appropriate level due to his underlying myelodysplastic
syndrome.  Per the neurosurgery team, his goal for platelets was
around 50 for three weeks; at the time of discharge, he will
require an additional week of platelets at this level, usually
achievable by giving two bags of platelets each morning,
checking a post transfusion count 30-60 minutes thereafter.
After this week has finished, he will be maintained at his prior
level, getting transfusion two to three times per week at
[**Hospital1 1388**] hematology clinic under the care of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**].  He will
follow-up with his hematologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**], for his AML in one
week and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**], a neurosurgeon, in two weeks
(he will get a repeat CT scan at that time).

2.)AML -- Mr. [**Known lastname **] is being treated with hydroxyurea and
transfusions as needed.  His WBC at [**Hospital1 18**] ranged between 12 and
28, generally around 14.  His goal hematocrit was over 25, and
he generally required one unit of packed RBC's every three to
four days.  Platelet requirements have been described above.

3.)Type two diabetes -- The prednisone Mr. [**Known lastname **] takes makes
his blood sugars somewhat difficult to control, however, a
regimen of Humalog 75/25 with 45 units every morning and 25
units at night seemed to work the best.  He was also covered
with a routine regular insulin sliding scale for excessively
high values (usually starting at 2 units of regular insulin for
a glucose of 150-200, and going up by two units of insulin for
every 50mg/dl of blood glucose increase).

4.)COPD -- Mr. [**Known lastname **] was maintained on Advair 250/50, one
puff twice a day.  He was also given an albuterol inhaler for
shortness of breath/wheezing that he rarely needed.  He became
wheezier in the middle of the admission, and was given twice
daily scheduled albuterol nebs to which he responded well.  We
would recommend continuing these for two more days, then
stopping them, leaving him on only Advair and as needed
albuterol inhalers.

5.)Fever -- One week prior to discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a
temperature to 101.  His blood and urine cultures were negative.
 Clinically and radiographically, his most likely source was
pulmonary, although the chest x-ray did not demonstrate an
obvious pneumonia.  He was treated with levofloxacin, and will
finish his course with seven more days of antibiotics.
