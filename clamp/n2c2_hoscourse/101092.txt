Mr. [**Known lastname 71063**] is a 77 yo M transferred from MICU [**7-7**] with
schizophrenia, neurogenic bladder, without guardianship, and
found to have pneumonia and bilateral pulmonary emboli causing
hypoxia/hypotension requiring pressors and intubation. He has
been relatively stable on the floor while undergoing treatment
for UTI.

# UTI- Currently has suprapubic catheter in setting of
neurogenic bladder and was found to have GNR's 10-100K in urine
on [**2185-7-3**]. Species on [**7-3**] was Alcaligenes achromobacter.
Patient complained of need to void urine on [**2185-7-11**] several
times which was new for him. His suprapubic catheter was changed
[**2185-7-13**] by urology. Levofloxacin was started on [**2185-7-11**] per
[**2185-7-3**] sensitivities; for total 14 day course (last day is
[**7-24**]).

# Acute Pulmonary Emboli: Patient previously on Coumadin. [**2185-6-24**]
CTA showed bilateral pulmonary emboli in the segmental and
subsegmental levels without evidence of right heart strain.
There was no clear cause for why he developed a PE. There was an
area of hypoenhancement within the atelectatic right lower lobe
along the periphery concerning for infarction. Increased
coumadin from 1mg po to 2mg po daily on [**2185-7-13**]. Further
increased coumadin from 2mg po to 4mg po daily on [**2185-7-16**]. His
INR has been difficult to manage, likely in setting of
antibiotics, malnutrition, Levothyroxine. On discharge, his
Coumadin has just been restarted at 3mg after he has been
supratherapeutic for the past 2 days. As an outpatient, he
should have his INR followed (check in 48-72hrs). If his INR <2,
he should be bridged with Lovenox 60mg q12h due to high risk for
thromboembolism. On discharge, he is on room air, slightly
tachypneic and tachycardic but has been stable.

# Tachycardia/Hypotension: Related to above.  Heart rates have
been in 80-110's. SBP <80s in the ICU requiring pressors.
Likely due to known pulmonary emboli with infection. Patient
does not currently have sx of infection, so sepsis is less
likely cause. It may be from pain, since patient is relatively
unable to communicate.

# Schizophrenia- Difficult to evaluate mental status. No
evidence of responding to internal stimuli. Baseline over past
few months [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3504**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] is that he is able to communicate
pain/discomfort but does not have capacity.  He is mostly lucid
but answers questions in mumbles and broken statements.  Patient
had court date for guardianship on [**2185-7-19**] which was approved.
He sometime says inappropriate comments but not frequently.
Patient was ambulatory in [**Month (only) 205**] with assistance per previous [**Hospital1 1501**].
We continued his Depakote, Risperdal, and Remeron.

# Pneumonia, MRSA: Treated with 8 day course of Vanc/Zosyn for
bilateral patchy infiltrate and found to be MRSA positive on
bronchial washings. Patient was hypotensive and hypoxic
requiring intubation and pressors for 10 days in MICU. Extubated
[**2185-7-6**]. [**2185-7-6**] CXR: Persistent opacification at the left base
with progressive clearing of right base without vascular
congestion. Later CXR cleared, he has finished treatment.

# Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine started this admission for TSH
8.6 in setting of acute septic shock. TSH 7.8 on [**2185-7-9**]. He
should continue levothyroxine 25mcg po daily. He will need
outpatient follow up of TSH in 1 month [**2185-8-8**]

# FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes prn, ground solids, if ever
needs tube feeds, needs post-pyloric b/c hiatal hernia

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Continued on Levofloxacin until [**7-24**]
- Guardianship obtained during admission.
- Will need outpatient psych follow-up
- He will need close management of coumadin with goal INR [**12-24**]
indefinitely. He should have a bridge with Lovenox 60mg q12 if
ever INR<2. Discharge Coumadin dose is 3mg.
- please check TSH and free T4 on [**2185-8-8**]. Patient started on
levothyroxine [**2185-7-3**] for low Triiodothyronine Thyroxine (T4),
Free 0.78* and TSH 8.5.
