Mr [**Known lastname 5239**] was admitted to the Trauma ICU [**2190-5-21**] upon arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**]. He was already intubated. His ICU course was dominated by
respiratory failure and inability to wean from ventilator. It
was felt he had an aspiration event, and that aspiration
pneumonitis was the primary cause of the respiratory failure.
Initially, he required muscular paralysis to maintain ventilator
mechanics, this was weaned off within 48 hours. He continued to
be hypoxic when attempting to wean him from CMV to CPAP, and CXR
showed possible infiltrate, so he was bronched and started on
empiric antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia. He
continued to spike fevers daily until HD 4. When his BAL results
came back as streptococcus pneumoniae, his antibiotics were
briefly narrowed to ceftriaxone monotherapy, then re-broadened
to Vanc/Cipro/Flagyl per the recommendation of an Infectious
Disease consult. To further assist in weaning him from the
ventilator, a lasix drip was begun HD 3 and run for 2 days with
good diuresis. By HD 4, he was transitioned to CPAP and
breathing well on his own mechanics. Also this day, he displayed
groin and back erythema, thought to be a combination of fungal
infection and drug reaction. On HD 5 he was weaned from propofol
and versed to Precedex while simultaneously weaning his PEEP
requirements. He was eventually extubated HD 6 and transferred
to the floor.  Also of note durinig his ICU course: He was
evaluated on CIWA scales but did not score significantly. He had
diarrhea while in the ICU, C.Dif was negative, resolved with
fiber. He was maintained on prophylaxis while in the ICU:
Heparin sub-cu, famotidine, VAP bundle.  He had a left
subclavian central line placed on [**2190-5-21**].
