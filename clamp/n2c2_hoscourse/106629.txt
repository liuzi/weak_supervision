The pt came intubated and sedated with propofol into the ICU.
The pt was not responsive and did not follow commands. He moved
all four extremities and did not seem in any acute distress. The
pt was switched from AC to CPAP with mmHg of PS before he
extubated himself about one hour into his stay in the ICU. He
was able to maintain good saturations and did not have any
respiratory distress. The propofol was stopped and the pt was
put on lorazepam for sedation. He was able to follow commands
and was orientated to time and person. He did not answer any
questions about the medications he took, but denied taking any
additional drugs apart from the ones that were prescribed for
detoxication.  The pt was kept on supportive care to allow time
for the metabolism of the drug OD.

Later in his admission the patient became agitated and
disoriented.  It was unclear as to whether this was stil related
to his initial drug intoxication or if he was undergoing
possible withdrawal.  It was also possible that the patient was
oversedated from the large quantities of ativan he had received
since admission.
The dose of Ativan was reduced and Haldol was added to the
regimen.

On day three of the hospital course the patient became oriented
X3 and was now following commands appropriately.
