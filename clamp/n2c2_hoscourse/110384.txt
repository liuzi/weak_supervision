The pt is a 48y/o M with PMH of Hepatitis C, HCC and alcoholic
cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status requiring
intubation for airway protection in the setting of suspected
opioid overdose.

Encephalopathy - The etiology of the patient's AMS was likely
multifactorial involving end stage liver disease,?anoxic-insult
given unknown down time, and opiate toxicity. Head CT negative
at OSH.  Upon admission, the patient was sedated and intubated.
Pt began regimen of lactulose with >4BMs per day; with a
decrease in NH4 from 140-->38 during his MICU stay. The
patient's mentation improved during his admission, sedating
medications were weaned down before extubation, and upon
transfer out of MICU he was A&O to person and place and
following commands.  Pt. was on CIWA on transfer to floor and
gradually cleared w/ less and less lorazepam. AT time of D/C he
was A/Ox3 for several days.

Respiratory failure/PNA ?????? Pt was intubated for unresponsiveness
and a GCS of 8 at an OSH. CT of chest demonstrated RLL
consolidation c/w possible aspiration PNA.  Upon admission to
the MICU, the patient was still intubated and sedated with
propofol. Empiric zosyn was started for coverage of aspiration
PNA which was changed to Unasyn on [**10-11**]. Repeat CXR on [**10-12**]
showed improving lung fields with no signs of consolidation.
Sputum GS grew GPCs in pairs, chains, and clusters on [**10-12**]. The
pateitn was weaned off sedation on [**10-11**], extubated, and placed
on 2LNC O2 with adequate oxygen saturation. Upon transfer, the
patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint. On the floor he
did not have any pulmonary distress, but did spike a fever to
102.5 while on unasyn, so he was switched to vanc/levo/zosyn.
His CXR was negative and he quickly defervesced so Abx were
stopped after a short course.

EtOH Cirrhosis/HepC/HCC ?????? Per recent history, the patient has a
h/o EtOH abuse, his HCC is rapidly progressing and his liver
function is rapidly declining. Upon admission, he had many
stigmata of liver disease, both on exam (encephalopathic,
scleral icterus, palpable mass in epigastric area c/w HCC mass
in left lobe, mild ascites, spider angioma, extensive
ecchymosis) and laboratory testing (elevated INR and abnormal
liver enzymes). Pt was given vit Kx1 without change in his INR.
The liver team was consulted and followed the patient during his
stay. An U/S of RUQ on [**10-12**] showed no signs of portal vein
thrombosis, cirrhosis and large infiltrative mass in the left
lobe of the liver c/w patient's known hepatocellular carcinoma;
there is probable new tumor ingrowth into the left portal vein
which is non-occlusive. Pt. was offered hospice house but could
not wait until this was available, he decided to leave AMA.

Hx of heavy EtOH abuse - The patient was maintained on CIWA
scale with 1mg of ativan per protocol in the MICU. The ativan
was weaned to 0.5mg on [**10-12**] and completely off two days later.
Pt. stated that he would continue to drink on d/c.
