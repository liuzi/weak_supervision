This pt is a 88yo female w h/o Parkinson's disease, mild
dementia and recent corneal transplant admitted to the hospital
for AMS and to the ICU for airway narrowing.
.
# Airway narrowing: She was noted to have swelling of the tongue
and lower lips on admission. A CT of the Head and Neck with IV
contrast showed no clear evidence of preseptal cellulitis and ?
of soft tissue infection/edema of neck and throat. Over course
of day, noted to have increased audible upper airway sounds with
good O2 sat of 97% on 2L which has been stable. ENT was
consulted and saw extensive edema and soft tissue swelling in
oropharynx with patent airway. Swelling around false cords,
tonsillar edema, but true cords without edema. The team thought
the swelling to be secondary to possible allergic reaction to
medications. She was started on solumedrol 60IV and famotidine
20mg. She was given one dose of zosyn and then switched to
unasyn to cover for possible soft tissue infection. Pt without
leukocytosis, fever (was 102.8 in the ED but afebrile since), or
abcess. ENT and anesthesia recommended transfer to ICU for
further monitoring. She was monitored and continued on Decadron
for three doses. During successive scopes by ENT, oropharyngeal
edema and some secretions were seen, but airway remained patent.
Unclear etiology: possible allergic reaction vs infectious
process vs both given tonsils appear possibly infectious and
lower airway appears more edematous and less infectious.
Lisinopril was stopped, and her laryngoscopic exam visibly
improved by the time she was called out to the floor.
-Pt was treated for 10 days for ?soft tissue infection and
switched to Augmentin for additional 5 days at dc
-ENT follow up appt was set up

# s/p corneal TP: lid edema on exam. Ophtho believes likely
secondary to blockage of drainage and not as likely due to
allergy.  Ophtho felt the eye was improving and recommended
decreasing doses of eye drops.
-FU appt with Optho set up
.
#. Altered Mental Status: On admission, she was lethargic,
possibly from the Haldol she received in the ED. By the time she
was called out of the ICU, she was likely at her baseline mental
status, pleasant and easily conversant. Shortely thereafter,
however, she became agitated and combative and received 1.5mg
Haldol and later the same day 5mg of Zyprexa. She remained
agitated for about 36 hours before she became lethargic and
barely arousable. Head CT was unchanged from before. She had not
had any new fevers or new signs of infection. She had a lumbar
puncture that was unremarkable. MRI/MRA was neg except for some
ventriculomegaly in setting of global atrophy which was
difficult to differentiate from NPH. Neurology thought it was
unlikely to be NPH. EEG showed some focal acitivity concerning
for sublinical seizures. Pt was started on keppra, initially
continued to have periods of somnolence along with R sided
facial droop (which was thought be Neurology to represent a
post-ictal state with [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis) but day before discharge
had significant improvement in mental status and was alert and
conversive. Due to hx of dementia and also ongoing hypoactive
delirium, pt was not fully oriented but did have significant
improvement in level of alertness.
-Pt curently is on Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week and to be
increased to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] later and kept at that dose.
-Pt should be followed by a neurologist at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
-Outpt FU w neurology is already set up
.

#. UTI: grew Enterococcus in UCx. She was continued on Unasyn
for 10 days.
.
#. Positive blood cultures: 1/4 bottles growing coag negative
Staph. This was likely a contaminant so vancomycin was stopped.
Repeat blood cultures were negative.

#. Parkinson's Disease: continued Sinemet except when patient
was too lethargic to safely take meds
.
#. Hypertension, benign: Lisinopril was stopped due to concern
of angioedema. Atenolol was continued.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia: continued statin
.
#. Hypothyroidism:  TSH normal on [**2119-4-6**] so not a picture of
myxedema and cannot account for MS change. Continued
levothyroxine.

#. Diabetes II, diet controlled without complication:
- insulin sliding scale while inpatient  and bs were wnl. Pt can
have [**Hospital1 **] finger checks to Rehab but since not needing insulin,
does not have to be on sliding scale

# Deconditioning: per PT eval, pt was 2 person assist and will
need significant PT therapy to get back to baseline where she
was walking with a walker
