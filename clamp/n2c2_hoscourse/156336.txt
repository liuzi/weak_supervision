Patient is an 80 year old male with history of CAD, CHF,
dementia, schizophrenia, chronic renal insufficiency, cardiac
dysrythmia who was admitted for sepsis.
.
1. Septic shock/infectious disease issues: Patient presented
from his nursing home with hypotension, leukocytosis, acute on
chronic renal failure, indicating sepsis.  Initial studies
demonstrated CXR with right lower lobe pneumonia, and u/a that
was positive.  Patient also with some cellulitis in left lower
extremity.  Therefore, intially thought source of sepsis was
pneumonia vs UTI vs cellulitis.  Cortisol stimulation test was
negative, ruling out adrenal insufficiency on admission.  The
patient was fluid rescusitated and initially started on levaphed
for pressor support.  He was maintained on vancomycin and zosyn
for broad spectrum antibiotics coverage.
Shortly after admission, patient had improved blood pressure and
levaphed pressor was weaned off.  Blood cultures from admission
grew coag negative staph, 2/2 bottles, likely source of this
infection being his left lower extremity cellulitis.  Therefore
he was maintained on vancomycin to complete a 14 day course.
Wound care nursing was also consulted and dressing changes were
applied per their recommendations.
For his pneumonia, sputum culture did not grow any bacteria.
Urine legionella antigen was negative.  Therefore patient was
empirically treated with vancomycin to complete a 14 day course,
as above, and zosyn, which was converted to levofloxacin on
discharge, for gram negative coverage to complete a 7 day
course.
For his presumed UTI, the patient had 2 positive U/A's during
the hospital course, with negative urine cultures.  The 3rd u/a
prior to discharge was negative, with a corresponding negative
culture.
Therefore, upon discharge, patient had a very stable blood
pressure, stable oxygenation off of oxygen, and was discharged
on vancomycin to complete a 14 day course and levofloxacin to
complete a 7 day course (started with zosyn).  He had a PICC
line placed prior to discharge.
.
2. Cardiac:
A. Ischemia:  Patient has a history of coronary artery disease.
On presentation, EKG demonstrated right bundle branch block
(last EKG in our system is from [**2092**] that demonstrates no RBBB -
however, obtained outside hospital records that does show RBBB,
so not new).  On admission, cardiac enzymes were elevated.
Cardiology was therefore consulted.  Patient was thought to be
having a demand ischemic event, and therefore was started on
heparin drip to complete 48 hours per cardiology
recommendations.  His outpatient aspirin dose was increased from
81mg to 325mg daily.  He initially could not be on beta blocker
therapy given his hypotensive sepsis.  Upon resolution of his
hypotension, his outpatient lopressor was re-started and
titrated up to his outpatient dose of 50mg [**Hospital1 **].  His CK peaked
at 372, and cardiac enzymes trended down throughout remainder of
hospital course.  No plans for cardiac catheterization given the
nature of his MI in setting of sepsis, and his co-morbid
conditions.
B. Rhythm:  Patient had a known history of some cardiac
dysrhythmia, but unknown type.  During hospital course, patient
was noted to have strange rhythm on telemetry and EKG.  The
electrophysiologist cardiologists were curbsided, and believed
the patient's rhythm to be due to wenkebach rhythm.  They
recommended no further intervention and believed that the
patient's outpatient digoxin could be discontinued.  Otherwise
patient was maintained on lipitor, as above.
C. Pump:  Patient has a history of CHF, and was on lisinopril
and lasix and digoxin as and outpatient.  All of these
medications were held on admission due to the patient's renal
failure and sepsis.  ECHO on admission demonstrated diffuse
disease, EF 20-25%, mod-severe aortic stenosis, mild aortic
regurgitation, mild-mod mitral regurgiation.  Upon resolution of
the patient's sepsis/hypotension, his lisinopril was restarted.
Digoxin and lasix were not restarted.  Spironolactone was
initiated given the patient's heart failure and low EF.  He
remained euvolemic during remainder of hospital course.
.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Patient with a history of
chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatnine thought to
be 2.0.  On day of admission, Cr was elevated at 2.9 and quickly
rose to peak of 5.6.  Patient was fluid rescusitated and Cr
dropped throughout admission and was down to 1.1 at time of
discharge.
During hospital course, the patient's lisinopril, lasix, and
digoxin were held due to the patient's renal failure.  Only his
lisinopril was restarted, as above.  His antibiotics were
renally dosed and adjusted throughout hospital course.
.
4. Anemia:  Patient had a hematocrit of low 30's on admission,
trended down to low of 26 during hospital course.  Iron studies
were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Patient was
transfused 1 unit of pRBC for Hct of 26, given his history of
CAD, and Hct bumped appropriately to 29, and remained stable
during remainder of .  ? baseline.  Hct increased to 29 w/ 1
unit pRBC.  Plan to:
- will f/u iron studies
- guaiac all stools
- tfs to keep hct > 28
- moniter
.
5. Facial eccymoses and erythema: Patient had noted left sided
peri-orbital facial erythema and eccymoses on exam on [**9-27**].
Radiology and opthalmology were contact[**Name (NI) **] as this was thought
possibley secondary to peri-orbital cellulitis.  MRI scan was
initially considered for futher evaluation.  However,
opthalmology evaluated the patient and thought it was unlikely
to be peri-orbital cellulitis, and therefore no imaging was
necessary.  This exam finding was thought likely secondary to
the heparin drip that the patient was on for his cardiac issues,
and continued to improve throughout remainder of hospital course
once heparin was discontinued.
.
6. Guidewire caught on IVC filter:  Patient had a right IJ
guidewire get caught in his IVC filter during his ED course.
This was removed by vascular surgery.  Patient was given 1U PRBC
in ED for fear of bleed.  Hematocrit remained stable.  Nothing
further was done.
.
7. Mental status:  Patient was somnolent on admission, likely
secondary to his infectious status.  He returned quickly to his
baseline mental status that included being awake, alert,
pleasant, responsive, oriented only x 1 to person.  He was
written for zyprexa 5mg PRN for agitation, but did not receive
any during hospital course.
.
8. Peripheral vascular disease:  Patient had dopplerable pulses
on this admission.
.
9. Coagulopathy: Patient on coumadin as outpatient for
dysrhythmias and lower extremity DVT.  Coumadin was initially
held given the patient's poor clinical condition.  It was
restarted during hospital course, and he was discharged on his
outpatient dose of 1mg qhs, with a subtherapeutic INR.  It
should be addressed with his outpatient primary care physician
whether or not to continue his coumadin, given his fall risk and
his risk vs benefit ratio.
.
10.  Hypernatremia:  Patient was quite hypernatremic during
hospital course, with sodium of 151 on admission.  This was
thought likely a hypovolemic hypernatremia.  His hypernatremia
improved slightly with initial fluid rescusitation.  The patient
then proceded to get free water boluses per his NG tube, which
continued to control his hypernatremia.
.
11.  Nutrition:  Patient underwent speech and swallow evaluation
early in hospital course which he failed.  Therefore he had an
NG tube placed and received tube feeds and medications per his
NG tube.  Upon improved alertness, patient underwent a repeat
bedside speech and swallow evaluation, which he also failed.
Following this, patient lost his NG tube.  He therefore had an
IR placed post-pyloric feeding tube to continue his tube feeds
and medications.  He was discharged with this tube in place with
plans for a repeat speech and swallow upon improvement at rehab.
 If he fails this, the issue of PEG tube placement should be
brought up with his [**Name (NI) 5993**], his sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 976**].
.
12.  Prophylaxis:  Patient was initially maintained on heparin
drip for his non ST elevation MI for DVT prophylaxis, which was
changed to subcutaneous heparin after 48 hours.  He was also
re-started on his coumadin as above.  He was also maintained on
a PPI.
.
13. Access:  PICC line was placed prior to discharge.
.
14. Code: DNR/DNI - per nursing home records and confirmed by
[**Name (NI) 5993**], his sister.
