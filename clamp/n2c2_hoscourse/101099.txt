The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2191-3-3**] and
underwent bilateral ileofemoral endarterectomies with patch
angioplasty and bilateral iliac stents.   The procedure was
without complications. She was closely monitored in the PACU and
then transferred to the ICU for ongoing gas exchange issues
related to baseline emphysema and diastolic heart failure. She
was transferred to the floor for further monitoring on POD #2 in
stable condition. We continue to monitor her breathing pattern
and gas exchange diuresing her with lasix to maintain a negative
fluid balance to treat her acute on chronic diastolic CHF
exacerbation post surgery.
Her diet was gradually advanced.  She worked with physical
therapy who recommended rehab. On POD # 7 she had an episode of
hypotensive causing ischemic colitis which was treated with
fluid/albumin.  By POD #9 her abdominal pain resolved and she
started to tolerate on a regular diet.   She was discharged to
rehab on POD # 13 in stable condition.  Follow-up has been
arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.

1.Peripheral Arterial Disease
sp  bilateral ileofemoral endarterectomies with patch
angioplasty and bilateral iliac stents on [**2191-3-3**] for disabling
claudication. Dopplerable LE pulses. Groin incisions are clean,
slightly red and should be covered with DSD until removal at
followup appointment next week.

2.Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure
She had acute exacerbation of her chronic congestive heart
failure after her procedure which we closely monitored and
treated with lasix as needed.  She is on her home dose of lasix
40mg daily.  Her PREOP WEIGHT is 77.1 kg.  TODAY'S WEIGHT is
85.7 kg.  We have been unable to diurese secondary to
hypotension and ischemic colitis.

3.Ischemic Colitis
On POD #7 she had an episode of hypotension to the 70's after
lasix administration. At that time, our goal was 1 liter
negative a day. Shortly after this episode, she had vomitting
with diarrhea with LUQ abdominal pain.  Her lactate level was
3.1 and her wbc rose to 23.3 from 7.6 earlier in the day. She
was aggressively resusitate her with fluid and albumin. An Abd
CT did not show any overt mesenteric ischemia. Flexible
sigmoidoscopy, to evaluate mucosa, was negative for ischemia.
Cdiff was also negative.  She was started on vanco/cipro/flagyl.
 She had continued improvement with return of her WBC to normal
and resumption of a regular diet by POD #9.

4.Hypertension
BP now 120's/80.  WE HAVE NOT RESTARTED HER HOME
ANTIHYPERTENSIVES/CARDIAC MEDS of amlodipine 5mg, diltiazem HCl
XR 360mg or moexipril 15mg secondary to relative hypotension
(90s systolic) in the setting of presumed bowel ischemia. Please
contine to monitor and restart medications as tolerated.

5.Chronic Kidney Disease
Admission Cr. 2.4.  Today's Cr is 1.3, likely related to holding
diuresis and ACE.

6.Emphysema
02 sats are 94% on 2L which is her baseline at home.

7.Atrial Fibrillation
HR 80s. Coumadin restarted post procedure. INR 2.8 today.  We
have held coumadin for the last several days.
