Due to his large perisplenic hematoma, Mr [**Known lastname 30362**] was admitted
to the Trauma SICU for close hemodynamic monitoring. On HD #1,
his serial HCTs were [**Last Name (LF) 30363**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a repeat CT AP was
obtained which showed extension of hematoma. He was transfused 1
unit PRBC + 1U FFP. In addition, his home digoxin restarted. On
HD #2, his diet was advanced to regular. Due to fluid overload,
he was started on a lasix drip with improvement in his
respiratory status. For pain control, an epidural was attempted
but could not be placed. On [**5-20**], however, a repeat attempt at
placement was successful with marked improvement in his pain.
Over the previous days he was quite delirious which greatly
improved with placement of the epidural, improved pain control
and cessation of narcotics. Heparin sc was started. EP
interrogated his pacemaker and discovered no fires or
arrhythmias. On [**5-21**], his lasix changed from drip to home PO
dose. Mental status continued to improve but he was kept in the
ICU as he had been so recently delirious. On [**5-22**], the patient
had continued stable hematocrit checks, was tolerating a regular
diet and A&O x2-3, so he was transferred to the surgical floor.
