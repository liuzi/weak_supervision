Mr. [**Known lastname 45855**] is a 44yoM with h/o multiple sclerosis, baseline
cognitive defects, chronic indwelling suprapubic catheter and
recurrent resistant urinary tract infections presenting with a
UTI and new onset seizures.
.
After initially being admitted to the floor, he developed
seizures requiring 10mg IV ativan and started on fosphenytoin
with a load and transferred to the MICU.  He was noted to be
increasingly somnelent with periods of central apenea.  ABG
showed acidemia with CO2 on the 70s.  He was started on Bipap
with improvement in his CO2.  It was presumed that his central
apnea was secondary to his large ativan dose which slowly
improved with clearance of the ativan.  He was started
emperically on vanc/ctx/amp/acyclivir to cover both his UTI and
for empiric coverage for meningitis given his AMS. A head MRI
was done, which showed unchanged appearance of extensive
demyelinated, w/ new curvilinear rim focus in corona radiatia,
likely site of active inflammation, no evidence of ischemic
event, unchanged marked global atrophy. Given that meningitis
was less likely he was narrowed to vanc/[**Known lastname **].  He began to
wake up over the day on [**3-19**] and was weaned off BiPap to a
shovel mask and transferred to the floor.
.
On the floor, he remained stable throughout the day on [**3-20**].
However, that morning was noted to be more tachycardic and
febrile to 103 in the setting of hypoxia to the 80s.  He was put
on a NRB and sats remained in the 80s for a while before
improving to the mid- 90s.  ABG on NRB was 7.48/40/72.  His eyes
were open but wasn't following commands and appeared obtunded on
the floor. CXR on the floor showed no new infiltrate.  Patient
was transitioned to the MICU and briefly broadened to
vanco/[**Month/Year (2) **]/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia, but quickly
narrowed given rapid improvement of respiratory status.  By
morning patient was alert and oriented X3, communicating and
breathing comfortably on 2L nasal cannula with saturation in mid
to high 90s.  Abx were again narrowed to [**Month/Year (2) 21347**]/Vanco for
coverage of UTI. Patient was then called out to floor.
.
#) Seizures (new): several possible etiologies in this patient;
he has severe multiple sclerosis, and though he has never had a
seizure before, there is a new area of inflammation on his MRI.
Infectious causes in setting of severe MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 45861**]
seizures, most notably his UTI. He was started on fosphenytoin
IV initially, then transitioned to phenytoin PO once mental
status improved. There was no sign of further seizure activity.
He will f/u w/ [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in ~2 weeks
.
# Altered mental status: per wife, was at baseline until the
seizures. 24h EEG did not show status epilepticus. Mental status
then to near baseline by discharge suggesting largely resultant
from infections/medications/post-ictal state.
.
#) Apnea/Hypercarbia: fully resolved as his mental status
improved once coming out of the MICU the 2nd time.
.
#) UTI: growing MRSA and pseudomonas. He will is on
vancomycin/ceftazidime, and will complete a 14 day course. A
PICC line was insserted and home infusion company will assist w/
antibiotics. There was a question of home aids flushing his
foley, thus potentially introducing pathogens. There should be
no flushing of the foley and this was addressed w/ wife and in
page 1 instructions.
.
#) Rash w/ vancomycin: pt did develop red rash on arms and face
w/ vancomycin infusion. Component of redman syndrome was
suspected. Benedaryl was given w/ vancomycin and this improved
his symptoms. There was no other evidence of allergic disease,
and no facial swelling or airway obstruction.
.
#) Thrombocytopenia- Bseline ~150's, went downt to 89 this
admission. No signs of active bleeding. No rashes on exam. He
had been exposed to heparin in the last 30 days, so PF4 antibody
was checked and was negative. His platelets responded to
baseline by discharge, and likely this was all secondary to
acute infection.
.
#) Multiple sclerosis: initially held home home baclofen given
AMS, but restarted by discharge once mental status improved.
.
#) HTN: continued home amlodipine
.
# CODE: DNI/DNR (confirmed with wife)

=======================================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# further seizure care per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Neurology
# PICC line is to be d/c'ed by home infusion company
# Foley catheter should NOT be flushed, except at the direct
recommendations of [**Name8 (MD) **] MD
