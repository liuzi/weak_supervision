Upon arrival to [**Name (NI) **] pt was treated with narcotics for pain of the
left lower extremity and back, and developed mental status
changes.  Her O2 sats acutely dropped, (etiology unclear, [**2-7**]
narcotics versus infiltrate), with tachycardia to 140s, hypoxia
to 88%, and CTA showing RLL/RML opacity but no PE.  Pt was
intubated for airway protection and transferred to MICU.
.
MRI spine on [**1-1**] revealed severe L3-L5 spinal stenosis.  X-ray
of the foot revealed left ankle fracture, for which she was
placed in a walking cast.  She also had cervical and
retropharyngeal abscesses, and was transferred to the SICU.
.
SICU Course
Pt was admitted to SICU post-operatively after L3/L4 & L5/s1
decompression/laminectomy for epidural abscess on [**1-2**].
Neuro: PT was admitted with altered MS, and was maintained on
propofol while intubated for sedation.
.
CV: PT had episode of SVT on [**1-3**], was shocked twice and
returned to [**Location 15364**] was consulted and recommended
amiodarone, which was d/c'd prior to transfer to floor.  Pt had
a TEE on [**1-14**] that was negative for thrombus (concern for septic
emboli).  Pt also had an IVC filter placed on [**1-14**] for PE
prophylaxis.  Pt was maintained on lopressor with tight BP
control while in the SICU, and she had no further cardiac
issues.
.
Resp: Pt was extubated initially on [**2183-1-5**], but was
re-intubated on [**2183-1-6**] [**2-7**] respiratory distress.  On [**1-9**], pt had
R VATS/decortication/washout for R empyema, and on [**1-17**] pt had a
pleural tap; the pleural fluid from [**1-9**] grew MSSA, and the
pleural fluid from [**1-17**] was no growth.  Additionally, the pt had
2 [**Doctor Last Name **] drains post-operatively that were pulled on [**1-16**] and
[**1-22**].
.
Musculoskeletal: Pt had L3/L4 and L5/S1
laminectomy/decompression on [**1-2**], on [**1-7**] pt had C5-6 ACDF
w/ICBG & Post Cervical decompression for cervical prevertebral
abscess, on [**1-9**] pt had knee tap with MSSA and subsequent bilat
knee washouts (left knee was not infected - the drains were
d/c'd on [**1-11**].  On [**1-24**], pt went to IR for drainage of L3,4,5
collection (approx 10cc out).  On [**1-25**], pt returned to OR w/
ortho spine for debridement of postoperative lumbar wound, and
decompression of L4-5 and repair of dural leak after pt was
persistently febrile and MRI of lumbar spine showed fluid
collection (+GPC per aspiration).  Pt last febrile on [**1-25**].
.
ID: Pt was initially started on nafcillin/gentamicin; initial Cx
were positive for MSSA and pt was maintained on nafcillin until
[**1-13**], when she developed a drug rash and was changed to
vancomycin.  Additionally, on [**1-18**] pt developed papular rash
over posterior thighs and peri-rectal area and was started on
acyclovir.  Pt was intermittently febrile without obvious source
throug much of ICU stay, but was afebrile for several days prior
to transfer to floor.  Her pertinent Cx data is below:
.
[**1-25**]: abscess Cx: coag + staph
[**1-21**]: UCx/BCx - NG
[**1-18**]: +HSV2; skin tiss: rare CSNx2, enterr, coryn, diptheriod
1/12,11: BCx/Ucx/Scx/pleural/cath - all NG
1/7,8: Ucx/Scx/BCx/cdiffx2 - all NG
[**1-10**]: L knee/cath - NG; R knee/pleur - MSSA; [**1-9**]: tissue/pleur  -
MSSA
[**1-8**] Bld Cx neg; [**1-7**] tissue/joint/wound: MSSA; [**1-2**] C5-C6 Cx:
MSSA
12/27,28,31: BLd Cx MSSA
GI: While patient was intubated, she was started on tubefeeds
for nutrition; following extubation, pt was advanced to a
regular diet without problem.  Pt was maintained on GI ulcer
prophylaxis with H2-blocker while in the ICU.

Medicine Floor Course
.
#Neuro: mental status improved spontaneously.  Neuro exam
stable.  CN2-12 intact, MAE. 4/4 strength B/L uppers, left >
right.  LE grossly intact bilaterally.  wiggles left toes.  hip
flexion, knee flexion and extension [**1-10**] b/l.  [**5-10**] [**Last Name (un) 15365**] and
plantar flexion of right LE.  left LE wiggles toes, mobility
limited by cast.  Per ortho/spine, pt full weight bearing,
though must wear hard cervical collar at all times, and TLSO
brace for 6 weeks whenever sitting up unsupported or out of bed.

-Vancomycin was continued per ID recs for multiple abcesses, at
least 8 week duration s/p [**1-25**] debridement. Hardware cleared for
repeat MRI if needed.
.
# ID: last fever on [**1-22**] was 102.3, pt was followed by ID for
multiple spinal abcesses, on vancomycin for MSSA given pt had
rash in reaction to nafcillin (seen by derm, "drug
hypersensitivity reaction" on [**2183-1-13**]).  Pt was placed on
acyclovir for perianal ulcers which grew HSV 2 on [**2183-1-18**], but
this was d/c'ed [**2183-1-28**]. Leukocytosis trending down with normal
diff.  Prednisone for RA as above, but further immunosupression
was avoided. Vancomycin was continued for now, plan for 8 week
course s/p last debridement on [**2183-1-25**].  Vancomycin end date is
[**2183-3-24**]. A psoas abcesses was too small to drain per IR.
Bilateral knee swelling s/p arthrocentesis and washout decreased
over time, without redness tenderness.
Needs weekly CBC w/diff, BUN/creat ratio, vanco trough.
.
# PULMONARY: pt initially presented without respiratory
symptoms, however was intubated in ED [**2-7**] increasing mental
status changes (?[**2-7**] narcotic medications) for airway
protection.  subsequent CT showed ?right side pneumonia.  Pt
extubated on [**1-5**] s/p OR for spinal procedure, then reintubated
on [**1-6**] (presumably [**2-7**] developing empyema felt [**2-7**] septic emboli
for which pt went to OR on [**1-9**] for VATS and chest tube
placement, though not clear), and extuabted on [**1-21**].  [**Name (NI) 15366**],
pt without SOB, on RA.  chest tube removed [**1-27**], and CXR s/p
removal showing small right side effusion, no PTX, no pneumonia.
 O2 was weaned, and ipratropium nebs continued.
.
# CARDIAC: Pt was placed on telemetry.  Episode of SVT on [**1-30**]
to 120s, no chest pain or SOB.  EKG showed sinus tachy, old RBBB
and new ST depressions in V3, V4 and inferior leads.  ST
depressions quickly resolved.  Troponin and CK-MB were negative
x 3.  Metoprolol increased in house to 75mg PO TID. ASA was
started.
.
# RENAL: pt with foley in place, presumably placed given initial
urinary incontinence, however, pt may be able to urinate on her
own now.  for now will continue foley given pt difficulty on
bedpan.  creatinine trending downward from 1.1. on admission to
0.5 presently, likely represents loss of muscle mass.
.
# GI: pt with h/o hiatal hernia, on omeprazole at home. Did not
have complaints of abdominal pain presently, LFTs and alk
phosphate mildly elevated on admission, now within normal
limits.  Pt tolerating regular diet without difficulty.  Per
intervential radiology, psoas abcess too small to drain.
Lansoprazole continued given steroid regimen.
.
# GU: no urinary complaints presently, foley in place presumably
[**2-7**] incontinence earlier during admission.
.
# ENDO:  pt on prednisone chronically for RA, and initially
received pulse dose of steroids (hydrocort/fludrocort) given
concern for adrenal insufficiency.  insulin sc sliding scale was
dc/d on [**2-1**] due to blood sugars less than 150 for 24 hours.
pt seen by endocrine service who recommend minimum dose of
prednisone 10mg po qdaily give almost certain component of
adrenal insufficiency.  home regimen of prednisone 15mg qdaily
(home regimen for RA) was continued
.
# PAIN: pt with h/o LBP [**2-7**] spinal stenosis, and myofascial pain
syndrome.  pt being seen by pain service during this admission.
 pt on ultram, oxycodone, and indomethacin at home.  Was placed
on hydromorphone transiently, but this decreased her alertness.
now on percocet [**1-7**] tab PRN, fentanyl patch, standing
acetaminophen and ibuprofen with meals
.
# RHEUM: Pt with h/o RA, on enbrel, methotrexate, indomethacin,
sulfadiazine (?) at home, however (except prednisone) all are
being held presently in light of multiple infections.  Knee exam
without obvious effusion presently, healing well s/p
athrothrocentesis.  will follow for now and encourage PT.
Continued on nsaids for RA. DMARDS were not restarted due to
abscesses. Should followup with her outpatient rheumatologist.
.
# PSYCH: Pt with h/o anxiety and depression, presently somewhat
anxious, especially during movement, transition to sitting.
Ativan was continuedprn.
.
#FEN: Advanced to regular diet with ensure for increased caloric
intake.  Mg and K were replete lytes as needed.
.
#PPx: Pt was given lovenox and IVC filter for DVT prophylaxis.
PPI given steroid regimen. Bowel regimen
.
# DC to Rehab.
