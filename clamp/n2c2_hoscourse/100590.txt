69-year-old male with severe COPD on home 4L NC, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, CAD, GERD, depression and chronic back pain on
multiple sedating pain medications and psychiatric medications
who presented with AMS, hypercarbic respiratory distress.

# Severe COPD & Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: Initial
desaturations and hypercarbia was felt to be related to
narcotic- and benzodiazepine-induced respiratory depression. He
is also a CO2-retainer at baseline. Patient had been taking
fentanyl patches, percocet, and ativan at home. The patient had
cultures with no growth, was afebrile, and had a clear CXR,
making infection less likely. Moreover, he had no sputum changes
or worse cough from usual baseline. He was initially treated as
a COPD exacerbation with albuterol/ipratropium nebs, solumedrol,
ceftriaxone, azithromycin. Ceftriaxone was ultimately stopped,
and steroids were switched to oral prednisone. He was continued
on a 5-day course of azithromycin. While he was in the MICU,
meetings were held with the patient, his family, and the
palliative care team. Given his advanced end stage COPD status
and his wished to focus on his comfort, the patient was made CMO
(comfort measures only). He was given the option of BiPAP to
help with his breathing but did not like the way the BiPAP mask
felt. Given his CMO status, his medication regimen was adjusted
(see below). He was discharged to a [**Hospital1 1501**], with plans for eventual
transition to hospice.

# Altered Mental Status: As above, felt to be secondary to
hypercarbia and narcotics. CT head negative for any acute
process. Mental status improved over the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course. Pt was started on haloperidol and clonopin to help with
anxiety and agitation. Pt's ativan was also increased from
nightly PRN to q6hours PRN.

# Coronary Artery Disease: Past medical history significant for
prior NSTEMI in [**2101**]. On admission, he had no complaints of
current chest pain or palpitations. After decision was made for
comfort care, many of his cardiac medications were stopped,
including lisinopril, pravastatin, and aspirin.

# Chronic Back Pain: Given concern for decreased respirations
and somnolence with hypercarbia, sedating narcotics were held on
admission. He was started on [**Year (4 digits) 1988**] tylenol as well as
lidoderm patches for pain control. At the time of discharge, the
patient was not complaining of any pain.

# Goals of Care: While the patient was in the ICU, meeting was
held between the patient, his family, the ICU team, and the
palliative care team. The decision was made to transition to
comfort care. Many non-essential medications were stopped at
that time (see medications section below). At discharge, he was
started on morphine elixir for shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**]. He was also
started on haldol and klonopin for anxiety, as described above.
He was discharged to a [**Hospital1 1501**], with plans for eventual transition
to hospice.
