54 yo M w/ETOH cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus, DM, ARF p/w
ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and w/u for liver transplant
.
# CIRRHOSIS: Patient's cirrhosis most likely secondary to
alcohol and patient was admitted with multiple complications.
Ultrasound at OSH demonstrated possible portal vein thrombosis,
although this finding was not present on 1st doppler study at
[**Hospital1 18**]. Patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis many times
during this admission. He was always negative for SBP. He was
continued on cipro for SBP prophylaxis. Pt's initial U/S was
unremarkable for portal vein thrombus, subsequent Abd U/S with
doppler as well as CT and MRI, notable for Portal vein thrombus.
Anticoagulation was contraindicated given his thrombocytopenia,
pt also developed some oozing around temporary central lines.
His clot then extended into SVC and was no longer a candidate
for transplant surgery. Further transplant work up stopped and
pt was made DNR/DNI given no further options for treatment.
.
# RENAL FAILURE: Patient was admitted with oliguric renal
failure. Patient's renal function decreased rapidly during this
episode of hepatic decompensation,  suggesting hepatorenal
syndrome although likely compounded by intravascular depletion
and increased intra-abdominal pressure. Patient was started on
octreotide, midodrine, and albumin at the OSH. Patient's SBP
dropped during HD from base line BP of 90's to low 80's. He was
then transferred to the ICU for CVVH. He tolerated several
sessions of HD. Plan for continued HD as outpatient as pt would
like to continue HD. Plan was to provide HD as outpatient close
to home. The patient was admitted to the MICU for ongoing CVVHD
given his pressures were prohibitive for traditional HD. The
patient was maintained on midodrine and octreotide for possible
hepatorenal syndrome and was additionally treated with IV
albumin, which was discontinued on [**2150-7-11**]. Midodrine was
increased to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. The patient's pressures tolerated CVVHD
well and his creatinine decreased from 5.9 to 2.5. He has
required dialysis, though, since being transferred from the MICU
to the floor, and his renal function has not improved.
Unfortunately, given his coagulopathy, he has had issues with
bleeding from the dialysis catheter site following dialysis. He
did not bleed following his last course of hemodialysis and was
deemed safe to go home.
.
# COAGULOPATHY: Pt developed some oozing around line sites. Labs
showed picture consistent with DIC but this could also be from
underlying liver disease. He received FFP/Cryo before
procedures. He recieved several units of PRBC for low HCT but
remained stable. Had some bleeding from tunneled line. Was given
conjugated estrogen and Vitamin K x 3 doses.
.
# HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: During this admission, patient had
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, suggesting likely hepatic
encephalopathy. Patient's mental status much improved with
lactulose therapy. The patient was maintained on lactulose for
encephalopathy. He was noted to have some fluctuation in mental
status but was generally appropriate and oriented.
.
# LIVER MASS: Patient also noted to have hepatic mass on
abdominal ultrasound, suggestive for possible HCC although AFP
only 2.9. Unclear etiology of mass.
