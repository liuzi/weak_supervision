  On the day of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer, [**2170-3-29**], patient
had some mild epigastric discomfort and complained to his
daughter of heartburn. Of note, he was on daily indocin while on
IL-2 therapy. At 10pm, he developed some diarrhea and then had
an episode of nausea and vomiting. The covering MD noted 2 very
large blood clots in the emesis. Noted increased RR of 40s, was
84% on RA and then improved to 100% on 4L NC. Biologics
attending was not concerned about other parameters, but was
worried about bleeding as patient may be at risk for bleeding
given his plts have dropped in the past few days.
.
Brought to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], GI team requested FFP, plts. Pt has guiac
positive brown stools, and complained of hemorrhoids and some
rectal irritation that may be contributing. He was not scoped
emergently that night, and his vitals were closely followed,
along with Hct.  His Hct was noted to be stable, with stable VS,
and no episodes of melena.  GI felt no emergent need for EGD.
He is receiving PPI [**Hospital1 **].  On [**4-1**], the pt was intubated for
respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary edema thought to be
secondary to capillary leak syndrome from HD IL-2.  He underwent
diuresis and was started on levo/flagyl for ?LLL PNA, started
[**3-31**].  On [**4-3**], levo/flagyl d/c'd as all cx negative, pt
afebrile.  Another reason abx d/c'd was b/c pt developed a rash
thought to be a drug hypersensitivity reaction, which improved
post d/c abx.  ID was consulted [**4-4**] for continued fevers and
recommended the initiation of broad spectrum abx incl.
Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Flagyl (stopped [**4-8**]), RUQ US to r/o
cholangitis (b/c pt had elev LFTs), and stated would not give
steroids, and would do bronchoscopy/BAL for most likely pulm
source.  Chest CT demonstrated b/l lower lobe infiltrates c/w
pulm edema vs. PNA.  Pt underwent Bronch [**4-5**], showing limited
eval of right sided airways, lavage with RLL post segment,
result: no PMN, no microorg, grew OP flora, PCP negative, AFB
negative.  Vancomycin was continued for ? line infection, and
b/c the pt had difficult access, his line was continued for 19
days.  He has been on Vanco for 8 days. The pt's LFT elevation
was attributed to IL-2 therapy, a known side effect.
.
Also, he was noted to have renal insufficiency, with Cr to 1.6,
and eosinophilia, with presumed AIN.  His creatinine continued
to rise to 2.6 (baseline 0.9).  He was given prednisone, which
was subsequently d/c'd.  Renal was consulted [**2170-4-5**] and
recommended for pt to increase free water intake.  They felt he
had a number of reasons to have ARF, including: capillary leak
syndrome, NSAIDs, infection, contrast on [**4-2**], and drug reaction
though no eos or WBC in urine.  The pt's creatinine demonstrated
slow improvement, was 1.4 [**4-7**], and on transfer from ICU, his Cr
was 0.9 (baseline).
.
Subjectively on transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the medical floor, the pt
felt well, is laughing and joking with family, and has no pain
complaints.  States his breathing if fine.  No cough, fever,
chills.  No N/V.  No abd pain.  No diarrhea or constipation.  No
dysuria.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.

________________________________________________________________
Impression:  A/P: 69 M with metastatic melanoma s/p IL-2
therapy, last dose at 3 pm [**3-29**], now with fevers, resp failure
[**2-15**] non-cardiogenic pulm edema; now improving, extubated [**4-12**],
and satting well on NC.  Resolved ARF.  s/p Drug
hypersensitivity reaction with discontinuation of all
antibiotics and improvement.
.
#. Pulmonary status s/p respiratory distress: Mr. [**Known lastname 64730**] was
intubated initially [**3-31**] for resp distress, thought secondary to
non-cardiogenic pulm edema from capillary leak syndrome from
Il-2, with possible contribution from PNA. LLL inbfiltrate on
CXR, fevers, but sputum never grew anything, so unclear if PNA
vs atalectasis. He was intially started on levaquin and flagyl.
Chest CT showed lower lobe infiltrates c/w pulm edema vs PNA.
Lenis were neg, but he did not have a CTA because of renal
failure. He has no h/o CHF, COPD or asthma. No Echo on file. The
pt was then taken off all abx on [**4-11**] because all cx data was
negative and fevers seemed likely due to acute interstitial
nephritis given eosinophilia, ARF, rash versus due to his
melanoma and IL'2 treatment. ID was consulted, recommended
bronchoscopy and labs, empiric sntibiotics for presumed Hospital
acquired PNA vs. line infection, so he was started on
vancomycin. Bronchoscopy from [**4-5**] was negative. He remained on
vancomycin for 8 days until his central line was pulled.  We
then discontinued Vancomycin IV.
-now on room air, sats stable
-nebs prn if needed
-chest PT, mobilize secretions
-IS to bedside and encourage pt to use
.
# ARF, resolved: this was thought to be acute interstitial
nephritis given fever, rash and ARF with peripheral
eosinophilia. However, eos negative in urine. Renal consulted
felt to be pre-renal also question contrast induced nephropathy.
This fully resolved with hydration, so finally appeared to be
most likely pre-renal and contrast related.  His creatinine
continued to be at his baseline.  We ended up restarting his
outpatient ACEI.  Will see PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week.
.
# Fever: Unclear etiology still, all cultures negative. He has
been hemodynamically stable. ID was consulted in the setting of
contemplating starting steroids.  ID recomended to r/o infection
BAL prior to starting empiric antibiotics, multiples serologies
histoplasma antigen, EBV viral load, CMV viral load, cryptococal
antigen, Strongiloides serology. RUQ u/s. All work up
unrevealing to date, and fevers tapered off. Afebrile for 6 days
prior to leaving ICU. Initial empiric a/b regimen with flagyl,
aztreonam and vanco was D/C'd .  He has remained afebrile on the
medical floor and has been instructed to report to the ED for
fever, chills.
.
#. Hypernatremia, resolved: Likely due to increase insensible
lossess. Free water boluses and D5w was given with normalization
of sodium.
.
#. ?Line infection:  Pt was continuing to spike fevers in the
ICU with a negative panculture workup and no infiltrate.  Other
sources excluded, so IV vamco empirically given.   His line was
pulled, no drainage and erythema at site.  His blood cx are
negative to date.  We stopped IV vancomycin on transfer to
medical floor, no evidence to support its use.
.
#. Metastatic Melanoma:  Il-2 therapy on hold for now. Plan per
Onc team, attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Doctor Last Name **].  His restaging lung
CT, head CT showed only mediastinal nodes largest 1.7 cm, could
not assess for pulm nodules given pulm edema.  The pt has follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
#. GI Bleed:  The pt had emesis with large clots on [**3-28**]. No
further bleeding, hct has since remained stable stable. The pt
can continue his PPI.  His Hct has remained stable, as well as
his vital signs.
.
#. Elevated LFTs: stable.  This is a known side effect of IL-2
therapy.  We held his IL-2, and trended his LFTs, which improved
over time.
.
#  Confusion/ICU psychosis:  Pt had vivid dreams as well as
hallucinations while in the ICU, and would often speak
inappropriately at times or answer questions with responses
unrelated.  He was started on low dose haldol.  On the medical
floor, the pt was appropriate in conversation, but would
occasionally state things that he was going to "[**Country 4194**] to herd
cattle."  On questioning his family, they stated that he has no
plans for a trip.  He is otherwise appropriate.  He has an
appointment to follow up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week. His haldol was
not given while he was on the medical floor.
.
#. Communication: with pt, wife and daughter [**Telephone/Fax (1) 64731**]
.
#. Nutrition:
The pt initially failed his speech and swallow study, however
the study was done a few hours post extubation, when the pt
still had copious secretions.  At the time of transfer to the
medical floor, the pt was swallowing and chewing fine.  He did
not experience any choking or coughing episodes with eating, and
he is tolerating a po diet well.  We did not repeat his swallow
study.  He does not appear to be an aspiration risk now.
.
#. Access: RSC multi-lumen [**3-26**] discontinued, now with pIV
.
#. Code: full
.
#. Proph: PPI, pneumoboots, heparin sq tid
.
#. Dispo: Home with physical therapy services. Follow up with
PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has a CAT scan scheduled for the last week in [**Month (only) 547**],
followed by a Heme/Onc appt on [**5-16**].
