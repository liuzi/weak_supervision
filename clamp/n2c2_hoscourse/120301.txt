72yo man with h/o EtOH abuse, DM, recently diagnosed
hypopharyngeal SCC admitted [**2108-8-7**] to ENT service for biopsy of
pharyngeal mass, G-tube and port placement.  Then transferred to
the oncology service on [**8-8**] for initiation of chemotherapy.  His
hospital course was significant for initiation of tube feeds
after failing a swallow evaluation.  Chemotherapy with
docetaxel, cisplatin, 5FU was initiated [**2108-8-11**], complicated by
diarrhea, severe cytopenias, ? leaking G tube, severe
nausea/vomiting.  On [**2108-8-19**], he received 10mg olanzapine for
nausea and subsequently became very lethargic and developed
fever, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and ultimately
transfered to the ICU [**2108-8-20**] for sepsis and neutropenic fever.
His ICU course was significant for diagnosis of LLL pneumonia,
hypotension attributed to hypovolemia [**3-8**] limited PO
intake/diarrhea vs. sepsis, improvement in acute renal failure,
hypernatremia.  He has had frequent atrial ectopy and PVCs and
electrolyte abnormalities.  ENT planned for tracheostomy [**2108-8-28**]
for airway protection during therapy, but on [**2108-8-28**] early AM,
he was found to have left facial droop.  MRI confirmed CVA
suggestive of thromboembolism.  TTE showed no evidence of clot.
Neuro recommended starting heparin ggt, which was started
[**2108-8-29**].  TEE could not be done given size/location of
hypopharyngeal mass.  Repeat TTE with bubble study revealed a
PFO and LE doppler U/S showed a RLE DVT.  The tracheostomy was
eventually placed [**2108-9-10**].  However, this was complicated by
bleeding over one week.  Anticoagulation was stopped as a
result.  A rechallenge with anticoagulation failed a second time
due to bleeding from his tumor and trach site.  He has
subsequently been managed with venodynes and prophylactic
heparin 5,000 units SC TID.  On [**2108-9-24**] he coughed out his
tracheostomy cannula.  Replacement was complicated by bleeding
and hemoptysis requiring ENT evaluation.  Bleeding/hemoptysis
resolved gradually over next 4 days.  He again developed
aspiration pneumonia [**2108-9-28**] and was started on cefepime and
vancomycin.  His respiratory status was stable and actually
improved rather quickly.  Antibiotics were stopped [**2108-10-3**].
Combination XRT and cetuximab was planned.  A loading dose
(400mg/m2) of cetuximab was given [**2108-10-3**] and radiation started
[**2108-10-10**] and will continue for 6 weeks total.

MICU COURSE:
Mr. O' [**Known lastname **] was admitted to MICU For airway monitoring after
trach placement.  Trach placement was uncomplicated.  On
admission, he was breathing comfortably and in no distress.
Post-op CXR was performed, which showed pneumomediastinum; this
was not unexpected given recent open procedure.  Repeat CXR
showed no change in pneumomediastinum.  Post-op trach care was
administered including airway suctioning as needed.  Tube feeds
were re-initiated with additional boluses of free water given
hypernatremia.  Enoxaparin was held overnight on day 1 of MICU
course because of bleeding from suction.  However, bleeding was
limited, so enoxaparin was restarted in the morning of MICU day
2.  Ophthalmology was consulted for continuing care of VZV; they
recommended continuing acyclovir.  He remained hemodynamically
stable and returned to the primary team.
.
OTHER DETAILS:
# Cough: CXR negative.  Cough may be due to XRT.  Continued
suction and humidified air via trach.
.
# Recurrent aspiration pneumonia/sepsis: Resolved.  Episode
[**2108-8-20**] required transfer to ICU with relative hypotension,
tachycardia, fever, hypoxia, and tachypnea.  LLL pneumonia on
CXR treated initially with vancomycin, cefepime, and
metronidazole due to concern for aspiration.  CXR [**2108-8-21**] and
[**2108-8-26**] showed worsening infiltrate, so abx changed to meropenem
with vancomycin [**2108-8-26**], finished [**2108-9-3**]. Concern for another
episode of PNA prompted use of vanco and cefepime [**2108-9-28**] -
[**2108-10-3**].  Continued to have secretions and rhonchi.  Guaifenesin
PRN cough.  Aspiration precautions.  AVOID sedating meds.
.
# Eye pain: Due to post-herpetic neuralgia +/- stye.
Ophthalmology consulted.  Started on lubrigel to maintain
hydration to eye surface.  Tramadol and acetaminophen PRN.
.
# Left eye lens implant (for ?glaucoma): Outpatient
bacitracin/polymyxin B used initially; stopped per
Ophthalmology.
.
# Zoster: VZV culture positive.  Started on acyclovir treatment
dose x10d, then changed to prophylaxis dose.  Ophthalmology
consulted; no ocular involvement initially, then filamentary
keratopathy seen [**2108-10-4**].  Pain initially controlled with
gabapentin, titrated off [**2108-9-15**] to avoid somnolence.  Restarted
gabapentin given increased pain; will titrate up dose.
Acetaminophen and tramadol PRN.
.
# S/P trach [**2108-9-10**]: Complicated by bleeding, resolved off
anticoagulation, now on heparin SC.  Cuff deflated [**2108-9-14**].
Routine trach change to uncuffed trach [**2108-9-17**].  CTA [**2108-9-20**]
showed soft-tissue swelling around the trach, but no active
bleed.  Coughed out trach tube [**2108-9-24**], re-bled then, now
resolved.  Airway suctioning PRN.  Continued telemetry for
continuous O2 monitoring (hospital policy for trach patients).
.
# Hemoptysis: As above.  ENT consulted.  No bleeding from tumor,
likely source is mild trauma from trach replacement.  Resolved.
- Change trach tube as needed or recommended by ENT/resp care
team.
.
# Hypopharyngeal squamous cell CA: T1N2bMx stage [**Doctor First Name **].  Started
cycle #1 TCF chemo [**2108-8-11**] complicated by N/V, severe cytopenias,
sepsis, and CVA.  Per ENT, the mass initially was filling the
hypopharynx and likely affecting his ability to handle
secretions though the airway was open.  Trach postponed due to
acute CVA, initially planned for [**2108-8-28**].  Per ENT (via
laryngoscopy), excellent response to chemotherapy with a ~90%
reduction in tumor size.  Unable to continue with TCF given
life-threatening complications, his treatment was changed to XRT
with concurrent cetuximab as a radio-sensitizer.  Loading dose
cetuximab 400mg/m2 given [**2108-10-3**].  2nd weekly dose delayed due
to insurance issues; given 250mg/m2 [**2108-10-12**].  Anti-emetics PRN.
Caphasol, Maalox/diphenhydramine/lidocaine PRN mouth pain.
Continue daily XRT with weekly cetuximab for six weeks total.
.
# CVA/PFO: Left face drooping seen [**2108-8-28**]; MRI positive for
CVA, likely embolic.  Neurology consulted and heparin gtt
started.  Aspirin started [**2108-8-28**], but stopped when heparin
started.  MRA brain unremarkable.  TTE negative for clot.  No
TEE given location of tumor.  Repeat TTE with bubble study
showed a PFO.  LE doppler U/S showed a RLE DVT, possible  source
of CVA and [**Last Name (un) **] (paradoxical emboli).  Heparin gtt changed to
enoxaparin.  Then stopped for post-trach bleeding complications.
 Restarted heparin gtt [**2108-9-19**] and stopped [**2108-9-20**] due to
recurrent trach bleed.  Continue heparin 5000U SC TID.  PT/OT.
.
# RLE DVT: Anticoagulation stopped due to trach bleeding.  IVC
filter considered, but decided against.  Continued heparin SC
PPx and venodynes.
.
# Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.7, peak 1.6, now
back to baseline.  Furosemide/metolazone given for anasarca, now
euvolemic.  Maintain adequate hydration with tube feeds/flushes.
.
# Paraphimosis: Urology successfully reduced it [**2108-9-14**].
.
# Diarrhea: Intermittent.  C. diff negative x2.  Loperamide PRN.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Chronic.  Suspected due to alcoholic liver
disease/hypersplenism.  Severe post-chemo, now back to baseline.
.
# Anemia: Chronic anemia but sub-acute drop due to chemo, then
post-trach bleeding.  Transfused 1U RBC [**2108-8-31**], [**2108-9-3**],
[**2108-9-10**], 2U [**2108-9-12**], 1U [**2108-9-14**], [**2108-9-18**], [**2108-10-1**], [**2108-10-9**].
.

infusions with furosemide/metolazone effectively diuresed.
.
# NIDDM: HbA1c 7.0 on [**2108-8-9**].  Endocrine following.  Insulin
glargine dose at 6U daily.  Cover with insulin sliding scale.
.
# Hypertension: Decreased amlodipine 10 to 5mg daily [**2108-8-30**] and
discontinued [**2108-9-13**] to change to metoprolol given ectopy.
Metoprolol dose increased from 12.5 to 25mg [**Hospital1 **].  Added back
amlodipine 5mg daily [**2108-9-20**].  Trigger for hypertensive urgency
[**2108-9-21**], so amlodipine increased to 10mg daily.  Started
lisinopril 5 mg daily [**2108-9-30**] for SBPs in 160s for several days.
 Increased lisinopril to 10mg daily [**2108-10-12**] for continued
