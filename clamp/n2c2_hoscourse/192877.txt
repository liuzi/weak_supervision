79 yo female with h/o a Atrial Fibrillation, s/p bioprosthetic
mitral valve replacement, admitted with post-op bleeding
following dental extraction and palate I and D two days prior to
the admission in the setting of being anticoagulated (INR in
therapeutic range).
.
# Bleeding: Post-op due to anticoagulation with warfarin use for
atrial fibrillation. Bleeding started on [**11-2**], increased [**11-3**]
in ED packed and pressure applied. INR 2.7, and hematocrit 27,
SBP in the 80's to 90's.  Hematocrit lowest at 21 on admission.
Bleeding from posterior palate Incision and drainage site.
Bleeding resolved with no events in the ICU. HD stable. Last
transfusion on [**2123-11-4**]. Received 2 units of FFP, one unit of
PRBC, fluid boluses and vitamin K. To medicine floor at
Hematocrit stable [**11-6**], but that night encountered bleeding
from I&D site, Afrin spray applied and pressure with resolution,
no PRBC's given, hematocrit 27.7. No further bleeding during
course of admission. Coumadin restarted [**11-10**] as per instruction
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. 3 mg initial dose, given risk for
stroke in patient with A-fibb. As per wishes of patient and
family, patient remained in house until incision site appeared
healed, INR increased and no evidence of bleed. Discharged with
follow-up by cardiology and her oral surgeon. Clindamycin 450 PO
Q6 for abscess stopped after IV then PO course for 10 days.
Coumadin increased to 5 mg on discharge.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Rate control with beta-blocker. Continue
Statin/ beta-blocker. Held Coumadin until [**11-10**] when restarted
given decreasing concern of rebleed. In discussion with Dr.
[**Name (NI) **], pt's Cardiologist in regards to anticoagulation.
.
# CHF: EF >65% in 1/[**2123**]. Continued beta-blocker. Restarted
[**Year (4 digits) 11573**] per outpatient dose 4 days into admission. Had been held
in MICU given hypotension. Fluids also given. Held Aldactone
during admission given elevated potassium and hypotension. With
increasing work of breathing 3 days prior to discharge, evidence
of increasing overload on CXR, [**Year (4 digits) 11573**] given. Pt stable on 40 PO
[**Year (4 digits) 11573**] and resuming 25 Aldacton [**Hospital1 **] at discharge with follow-up
in the heart failure clinic.
.
# Hypotension: likely secondary to hypovolemia. Fluids given on
admission. Stopped as evidence of overload. Baseline low normal.
.
# CRI: Creatinine slowly trending up. Baseline ranging from
1.9-3.0. Stable as baseline at discharge. Continued renal diet

.
# FEN: Soft diet given abscess site tenuous for rebleed.
