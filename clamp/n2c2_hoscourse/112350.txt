Mr. [**Known lastname 65004**] is a 49 yo RHM with h/o bipolar/schizoaffective
disorder, hypothyroidism, who was transferred with complaints of
headache for about a month and nausea. Upon admission he was
found to have a large left parietal hemorrhage. The exam upon
admission was notable for inattention, anomia, right field cut,
mild-moderate R hemiparesis, and perseveration.
.
Neuro:
The patient was transferred to the Neuro/ICU  for telemetry and
aggressive blood pressure control. Neurosurgery evaluated him
and no surgical intervention was necessary. His MRI/MRA scans
revealed a large (~40cc) hemorrhage near the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction
in the left parietal lobe. There was no clear underlying mass
and there were no underlying vascular abnormalities per MRA (no
aneurysms/AVM). An ECHO, to look for a cardio-embolic etiology,
was negative (no valvular vegetations or intracardiac thrombi;
no PFO/ASD, but not with certainty as the image quality was
poor).
Mr [**Known lastname 65004**] then developed a L thalamic infarct [**1-8**], and was
less alert, with increased R hemiparesis. An EEG ([**1-8**]) showed
focal slowing in the L anterior quadrant. A hemorrhagic
conversion of the infract was then noted on [**1-12**] with some
intraventricular blood (found incidentally when getting CTV).
The CTV ([**1-12**]) showed a L superior sagittal sinus thrombosis
and ?L sigmoid sinus thrombosis  with extension into the
internal jugular vein. A repeat head CT [**1-14**], showed no
evidence of hydrocephalus, and no further blood in 4th
ventricle.
Mr. [**Known lastname 65004**] was started on anticoagulation with Lovenox on [**1-13**].

He was also given a short course of Diamox for L hemisphere
edema. Neurosurg was re-consulted to monitor the hemorrhage into
the 4th ventricle given the risk of hydrocephalus. No
intervention was necessary. Follow up CT-head series showed a
stable picture.
.
Psychiatry:
The patient was maintained on seroquel. Depakote was
discontinued, and lithium was started [**1-6**]. Lithium levels
should be monitored closely (every 2 weeks) and the dosing
should be adjusted accordingly. The patient has been closely
followed by the psychiatry service. Please contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65005**],
[**Numeric Identifier 65006**] if any questions arise. Close follow up will be
arranged. Haldol was given on a PRN basis.
.
Cardiovascular:
An Echo showed an EF>55%. The patient was ruled out for an MI
[**1-8**]. Goal SBP<160. Lipids profile was within normal limits.
EKG should be checked if the patient receives haldol on a
regular basis (risk for prolonged QT).
.
FEN/GI:
-cardiac prudent diet
.
Hematology:
The patient was noted to be thrombocytopenic w/nadir in 80s,
likely secondary to Depakote. Plt normalized after Depakote was
discontinued.
As part of a workup related to the sinus thrombosis the
following tests were done:
-No LE DVT on [**1-11**] U/S.
-Hypercoagulable workup: Fibrinogen 482, D-dimer 2938.
Homocysteine wnl, [**Doctor First Name **] neg, Lupus anticoagulant neg, ATIII wnl,
FVL neg. Prot C slightly low 63, Prot S elevated (?acute phase
reactant). Factor VIII and anticardiolipin normal. Prothrombin
gene mutation pending. Please resend hypercoag workup again in
the future if Pt ever comes off anticoagulation.
The patient was started on anticoagulation with lovenox as he is
not a coumadin candidate. Lovenox level 2.0 on [**1-26**], after which
the dose was decreased; level on [**2-1**]: 1.06; level on [**2-3**]: 0.9
(i.e. within goal range).
.
Other:
The patient has had multiple falls [**12-31**], [**1-5**], [**1-6**] x2, all
secondary to orthostasis, a R field cut, and impulsivity. Please
check orthostatics in case the patient is unsteady.
.
Endocrine:
-TSH 3.4; Levoxyl was continued. Please continue to monitor.
-HbA1C 5.2, no intervention needed.
.
ID:
On Cipro [**Date range (1) 14813**] for E. coli UTI. UA on [**2-2**] was negative.
.
ENT:
Sinus opacification upon admission. This has resolved. If
patient becomes symptomatic he will need ENT follow up.
.
Legal: Mr [**Known lastname 65004**] has a legal guardian since [**1-30**]. [**Name2 (NI) **] is
incompetent to sign consent for procedures as he cannot clearly
understand its risks and benefits. His sister who had been his
previous guardian was legally not permitted to hold this
position any longer.
