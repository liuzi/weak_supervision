# GIB - To evaluate her GI bleeding, an EGD and colonoscopy were
performed. Colonoscopy clear. EGD shows antral erosions. H.
pylori studies were negative. Anticoag risk: bigger cardiac/CVA
risk of not anticoagulating, compared to anticoagulation risk
for GIB. She was put on a planned course of [**Hospital1 **] PPI for one
month, and daily PPI thereafter. She was bridged back to
coumadin with a heparin drip, a process which took considerable
time.
.
# HTN: held ACE and BB for concern for possible new bleeding and
risk for hypotension, monitored closely. Normotensive with
regular rate in the hospital, and did not restart these
medicines in the hospital or on discharge.

coumadin in preparation for procedure, and until therapeutic
after EGD/[**Last Name (un) **]. This latter heparin to coumadin bridge took
