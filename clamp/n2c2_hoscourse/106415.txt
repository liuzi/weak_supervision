61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF.
During IR placement of an HD catheter he suffered a PEA arrest x
2. He was cooled using artic sun protocol. He slowly recovered,
but his hospitalization was complicated by prolonged intubation
leading to tacheostomy placement, Psuedomonas UTI, HAP,
Stenotrophomonas PNA, aspiration PNA, acute on chronic kidney
injury leading to loss of fuction of his transplanted kidney,
IVC thombosis, spontaneous intrahepatic hemorrage during
heparinization for his thrombus, gout flair, and altered mental
status which has slowly improved. After more than a month in the
hospital he has stabilized, is ambulating with assistance,
speaking through a Passe Muir valve, and tolerating tube feeds.
.
# Aspiration:  Patient had emesis [**2107-12-13**] and aspirated tube
feeds. Developed aspiration pneumonitis vs. aspiration PNA. CXR
showed no clear evidence of PNA but CT showed confluent
consolidative opacity of superior RLL. Pt was febrile following
aspiration event and ended up re-intubated. Now s/p 7-day course
of vanc/zosyn for aspiration that ended on [**2107-12-18**]. Respiratory
status has dramatically improved and he is now on trach mask
only. He had a video swallow evaluation on [**2107-12-20**] which showed
silent aspiration.  It was suggested that he have a diet of
nectar thick liquids and soft consistency solids.  meds must be
crushed in purees with Q6 hour oral care.  He should have follow
up with speech therapy at rehab with repeat video swallow if
diet is to be advanced.
.
# Stenotrophomonas PNA: Diagnosed from repeated sputum cultures.
On Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]. Note that
Bactrim must be give FOLLOWING HD as it is dialyzed off.
Intially diagnosed [**12-2**], but was inadquately treated as Bactrim
was given prior to HD rather than after.
.
# Pseudomonas UTI: Had a long course of Cefepime for UCx
positive for Pseudomonas x 2.
.
# Line infection: S/p Cefepime initially for UTI. Then Linezolid
was added for purulent appearing CVL. His lines were exchanged
and complicated by PEA arrest during procedure. His CVL grew out
Micrococcus. According to ID, the Cefepime should have covered
it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
Linezolid. A PICC line and new HD line were placed and have had
no further complications.
.
# Labile blood pressures: Pt had been intermittently hypotensive
(infectious source vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency). His
infections were treated. He was given stress dose steroids. He
was on pressors for hypotension. Ultimately this resolved and he
became persistently hypertensive to the 190s to 220s. He was
started on a labetalol drip as well as PRN hydralazine. He has
been transitioned from Labetalol drip to PO Labetalol on [**12-9**],
then switched to Labetalol PRN. On [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c??????ed.
Continue atenolol at 50mg daily. Continue lisinopril 10mg daily.

.
# Foot Pain:  Likely gout, particularly given resolving hematoma
and renal failure. Receiveing pulse steroids with Prednisone
40mg daily x5 days starting on [**2107-12-20**]. Will resume chronic
Prednisone 5mg PO daily for maintenance of transplanted kidney
thereafter. [**Month (only) 116**] need suppressive allopurinol in the future for
his gout.
.
# DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver
hematoma developed (see helow). Hematology was consulted
regarding whether it is appropriate to resume anticoagulation
given the risk of bleed, and recommended SC Heparin tid until he
follows up with Hematology and possibly vascular surgery
regarding possible benefits vs. risks of an IVC filter
placement. The patient should not be anti-coagulated with agents
other than SC Heparin given his high risk of bleed.
.
# Abdominal Distension:  Patient??????s abdomen became distended and
tympanitic during this hospitalization. CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed
large liver hematoma with scattered areas of perihepatic
hematoma and scattered blood within the mesentery but without
definite sites of active extravasation.  Distension likely [**2-7**]
chemical peritonitis which is resolving following reversal of
anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]??????s syndrome from
infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient??????s
continued +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not
show dilated R side of colon and loops of bowel were read as
WNL.  Currently improved abdominal pain and minimally improved
distension. Abd is much less tense than prior.  Continue Reglan
2.5mg TID standing for treatment of presumed diabetic
gastroparesis. Advancing diet as tolerated with tube feeds.
.
# Liver Hematoma:  As above, CT showed hematoma of liver while
on heparin drip for IVC thombus.  IR consulted re: possible
embolization, did not feel the bleed was acute (felt >48 hours
old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery and liver function if
possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General surgery
consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the
hematoma.  Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing
as needed and keeping Hct >20.  Received total of 3 unit pRBC
after reversal of PTT with FFP. Awaiting hematology
recommendation for long term anticoagulation given presence of
IVC thombus but complication of hemorrhage. (Ultimately decided
to hold all anticoagulation given severity of liver bleed.)
.
# Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest
with hypoxia beforehand. Was very difficult to wean from vent
due to persistent hypoxia, recurrent PNA, and altered mental
status. Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**]. Now stable on trach. Had
aspiration even as above leading to short tern re-intubation.
Now tolerating trach mask. Speaking with Passe Muir valve.
.
# Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest: S/p PEA arrest x 2.
Underwent Artic Sun cooling protocol. Suring weaning of sedation
was severely agitated. Ultimately was transitioned from fentanyl
to methadone and then weaned on seroquel. He had a significant
set back from his liver hematoma and aspiration PNA. Neuro was
consulted and noted a staring spell that was concerning for
seizures. He was monitored with continuous EEG, which showed
epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. Neuro
recommended startingKeppra, with Keppra 500mg qday and an extra
250mg after HD. The patient has slowly improved and is not
conversant, [**Location (un) 1131**], walking with assistance, and no longer
agitated. He is alert and oriented.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure. He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].
Etiology of ARF likely multifactorial due to hypotension from
PEA, sepsis, contrast loads, and nephrotoxic drugs. Her the
Renal Service, he will not recover renal function of his kidney.
He will require HD henceforth. Continue prednisone 5mg PO daily
for rejection as well as Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 800 tid.
.
# FEN:  Speech and Swallow Recs - video swallow: silent
aspiration seen on s/s for thin liquids. Recs: 1. Suggest a PO
diet of nectar thick liquids and soft consistency solids. 2. PMV
on for all POs. 3. Meds crushed with purees. 4. Monitor for
nutritional intake. 5. Q6 oral care. 6. Follow up speech therapy
in rehab s/p d/c
