A/P: 86yo man with h/o CAD, DM2, HTN, CRI, pancytopenia, a/w
hypothermia, bradycardia, profound pancytopenia, found to be
hypothyroid.
.
1. Hypothyroidism, Primary: patient was found to have TSH on
admit of 9.0, repeat was still elevated at 7.3; T4 was low at
3.9, c/w primary hypothyroidism; pt was started on Synthroid
112mcg/day. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test was negative. Endocrine was consulted
and did not feel many of his symptoms were secondary to
hypothyroidism. They wanted to decrease his synthroid to 50 mcg,
recheck his TSH in 1 week and then decrease again to 25 mcg.
This should be done at rehab.

2. Bradycardia: thought likely [**2-19**] hypothyroidism, maintained on
on tele, had episodes of brady down to 35s occassionally with
longest pause 2.2 seconds. Cardiology evaluated while the
patient was in the MICU, said that the patient did not require
pacer but to continue to monitor for drops in pressure or
symptoms, which patient did not have during his hospital stay;
thought likely to resolve as Synthroid takes effect. Will need
outpatient follow up.
.
3. Hypotherm: also likely [**2-19**] hypothyroidism, will warm as
needed for now. Did not improve with synthroid. On discharge has
temp of 92.7, so there  is likely a central cause for this of
unknown etiology. The patient should be followed closely, if his
temp drops farther, he should be rewarmed.

4. Pancytopenia: patient was noted on admission to have WBC 1.9
down from baseline 6.0, Hct 26.2 down from baseline 30, plts 21
down from baseline 90-100. Patient currently receiving Epogen
?5000 or 20,000 units/week, received at the VA, but not followed
by a Hematologist. Has had fairly stable counts until [**2174**].  In
[**11-19**] anemia began, and was thought to be [**2-19**] kidney disease.
EGD and cspy in [**5-21**] were negative for bleed, iron studies were
c/w anemia of chronic disease with low retic count 1.7%. Heme
recommended increasing his Epo to 40,000 units per week, which
was initiated while he was in house on the night prior to his
discharge. Heme also noted that his peripheral smear contained
strange-looking cells suspicious for myelodysplastic process.
They do not feel that a BM biopsy would change his management,
but plan to follow him in clinic. Of note, the patient's WBC
count returned to the patient's normal range, his hct remained
stable after receiving 2 units PRBCs. His plt count remains low
but is slowly trending upwards. He has had no evid of bleeding
but we are holding ASA given this significant risk (he has a h/o
falls)
.
5. Blood sugars: pt has h/o DM2, was started on RISS as
glyburide was held, then patient became hyponatremic, possibly
because of hypothyroidism; was on a D5W drip briefly, RISS
adjusted to keep sugars in check; pt seems very sensative to
insulin at bedtime when he is not eating, so this scale was
decreased compared to his daytime dosing. If patient needs to be
started on a oral hypoglycemic, he should not be restarted on
his glyburide as it is renally cleared. Glipizide can be
considered.
.
6. ARF: pt's creatinine bumped to 4.1 from 3.5 on day prior to
discharge; likely prerenal in setting of overdiuresis, net
negative 1700 day prior. Rehydrated gently with 500cc, rechecked
BUN and Cr afterwards with resolution. Baseline Cr 3.5.
.
7. Constipation: possibly [**2-19**] hypothyroid, increased bowel
regimen
.
8. CAD: CEs flat, ASA held [**2-19**] low platelets; cont statin;
holding BB [**2-19**] AVB, bradycardia. He should not be restarted on a
beta blocker.
.
9. CHF: patient was initially felt to be a bit overloaded [**2-19**]
his CXR and his clinical presentation; this was thought to be
due to a combination of bradycardia, anemia and possible
infection; TTE showed LVH but no evid of worsening heart
function with LVEF>55%. Pt was initially diuresed with Lasix
40mg IV as needed, then became overdry with bump in creatinine,
was given some fluid back via NS boluses, and is being
discharged euvolemic.
.
10. ?LLL pna: thought to have evid of pna (?aspiration) on
initial CXR, started Levaquin x 7days ( started on [**1-6**] to stop
[**1-12**]). Needs 1 more day.
.
11. HTN: continued prazosin, increased to 2 mg prasozin at
night, also increased Hydralazine.  We avoided ACEI given
ARF/CRI, and avoided BB given profound bradycardia.
.
