# Acute on Chronic respiratory failure:  The patient was
admitted due to altered mental status and low tidal volumes.
The patient with known traumatic intubation at OSH c/b tracheal
injury, and trached here requiring multiple revisions.  Also
with COPD. Patient went into respiratory distress with hypoxia
and hypotension.  She was started on levophed and [**Month/Year (2) 1834**]
emergent bronch.  The bronch showed granulation tissue
obstructing 95% of her tube.  The tube was passed farther down
past the site of obstruction and the patient's respiratory
status improved and was weaned off levophed.  The patient then
[**Month/Year (2) 1834**] repeat bronch the following day on [**1-15**] that showed
the tube to be patent and the tracheal laceration to be healing
well.  The patient's respiratory status remained stable and her
ventilator settings at the time of dicharge were: CMV, Vt
(Set):450, RR (Set): 14, PEEP: 5 cmH2O, and FiO2: 40%.  The
patient was also treated for a VAP based on CXR (left
retrocardiac opcaity and increasing sputum).  She was started on
Vanco/Cefepime on [**1-16**] for presumed VAP.  She was then changed
to Vanco/Meropenem given her ESBL urine cx results.  Her sputum
subsequently grew out GNR and she will continue vancomycin and
meropenem for a planned 8 day course (last day:[**1-24**]).  A PICC
line was placed on [**1-18**].  The patient did have a low grade temp
of 100.5 at the time of discharge.  This was discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 84121**] at [**Hospital1 **] and is aware.

#. VAP: See above for respiratory course.  Patient with planned
8 day course of meropenem with final day being [**2169-1-24**].  Sputum
is currently growing GNR and needs to be followed up for final
speciation and sensitivities.

#UTI: The patient was intially treated with ciprofloxacin on
admission for a positive UA.  She was then broadened to
Vanco/Cefepime given she was at rehab for resistant organisms.
The UCx returned ESBL E. Coli and was switched to meropenem for
a planned 8 day course (last day [**2169-1-24**]).

# Altered mental status:  The patient came in minimally reactive
which was a change from her baseline per the family.  Her change
in mental status was attributed to her infection and after
treatment for her VAP and UTI her mental status returned to
baseline.  She is able to follow very simple commands and answer
some simple yes/no questions.

# CHF:  The patient had an EF 25% per report.  Her metoprolol
and lisinopril was held given her infection and normal blood
pressure. Additionally, her lasix was initially held.  The
patient was restarted on her metoprolol at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], but
several doses were held secondary to hypotension and
bradycardia.  Her blood pressure and heart rate should be
monitored at rehab and titrate metoprolol accordingly.  The
patient was restarted on her lasix 20mg po BID given her volume
overload. Her weight, respirtory status and I/O should be
monitored and lasix titrated at rehab.

#Anemia: The patient admission Hct was 26 and slowly trended
down to Hct 21.  Her hemolysis labs were negative and there were
no signs of active bleeding.  Her guaiac was negative.  She was
trnasfused one unit [**1-18**] and her Hct remained stable.  Upon
discharge her Hct was 25.7.

# PEs:  Patient with recent diagnosis in [**11-30**].  The patient was
continued on coumadin 3mg daily and brdiged with lovenox 60mg
q12 for a subtherapeutic INR.  Upon discharge her coumadin was
increased to 5mg daily and continued on lovenox 60mg [**Hospital1 **] until
INR >2.0.

# C2 fracture:  Patient with C2 fracture after a fall on [**10-31**].
She was maintained on a [**Location (un) 2848**] J-collar.  The patient should have
follow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient.

# AFib:  Patient's metoprolol was initially held due to ongoing
infection.  Her metoprolol was restarted on 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and
continued on systemic coagulation.
