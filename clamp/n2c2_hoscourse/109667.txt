ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 39 yo female with history of T-cell NHL in
remission with recent abnormal PET scan findings under further
investigation, with fever, hypotension of 12-hour duration,
responsive to IVF.
*
1) Fever, hypotension: Resolved after one night. Although her
presentation most suggestive of severe sepsis, with elevated
lactate and hypotension responsive to IVF resuscitation, the
rapid resolution was more consistent with an anaphylactic
reaction to IV contrast from the CT.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] has reported a
similar admission where the patient presented with a septic
picture which subsequently resolved without localizing a source.
Sbe was treated with the sepsis protocol and broad-spectrum
antibiotic coverage with cefepime and levofloxacin.
Hydrocortisone was given in the emergency room, so [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim
test would have been useless.
*
2) T-cell NHL in remission: Recent PET findings were concerning
for disease recurrence, although CT neck without
lymphadenopathy. Her Acyclovir and Bactrim prophylaxis were both
continued. There were no active heme/onc issues during this
admission.
*
3) ARF: Creatinine up to 1.4 on admission, decreased to normal,
suspect pre-renal physiology given elevated specific gravity and
improvement with hydration.
