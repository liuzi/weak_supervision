DISCHARGE SUMMARY (as of [**2167-5-27**])
Assessment and Plan:
This is a 53 year old woman with coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure, copd, pulmonary hypertension, s/p L
AKA who is oxygen dependent on nasal canula 4 liters at home,
and polysubstance abuse who presented to [**Hospital3 35813**] Center
in [**State 792**]with altered mental status, hypoxia, and
agitation.  She was intubated for airway protection and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Course complicated by anuric renal
failure requiring dialysis.
.
1)Mental Status change:
Most likely multifactorial, as patient with previous
polysubstance abuse.  Chronic small vessel disease noted on head
CT.  EEG negative for seizure activity.  Per family, patient
lives alone and able to care for herself and perform activities
of daily living.
On admission, toxicology screen revealed opiates and tricyclics,
and by medical notes on transfer, patient had been using more
sedating medications than normal.  Neurology evaluated patient
and vitamin B12 and folate levels were normal.  She received
thiamine.  TSH level was elevated to 8 and her T4 was only very
slightly below normal.  Thus, thyroid function was not
attributed to altered mental status.  An EEG revealed
encephalopathy, but no seizures.  CT head revealed chronic small
vessel disease.  LP and MRI were deferred.
-Upon extubation, patient slowly became more alert, first with
purposeful eye tracking and then by following simple commands.
She received Haldol and Ativan, which sedated her profoundly for
several days. Then, after extubation, she began to have
conversations but with frequent outbursts with cursing at times,
poor attention and short term memory.  She became febrile on
[**2167-5-7**], which was concerning for a line infection, and was
treated initially with Vanco/Zosyn changed to Vanco/Meropenem
plan for 3 day course complete [**2167-5-9**]. C. diff negative x3.  Her
head CT was unchanged.
On [**5-13**], patient had her PICC line and tunneled HD line placed
and developed fevers within 12 hours.  Only one blood culture
from [**5-14**] revealed one bottle of staph coagulase negative
organisms.  Treated with ten day course of vancomycin (per HD
protocol) through [**5-23**].
-Lexapro was restarted on [**2167-5-12**], but held on [**5-22**].
Psychiatry continued to follow patient and for continued
outbursts  recommended haldol 0.5mg PO/IV three times daily.  As
above, concern that heavy sedatives with ativan and haldol cause
profound sedation.  She required soft wrist restraints for
prevention of line removal. Pt was transferred to the MICU on
[**6-2**] for respiratory compromise (see below).
-Upon arriving at the floor on [**6-5**] the patient was AOx3, but
with residual confusion, impulse control issues, and aggitation.
 Her course was complicated by recurrent episodes of aggitation
and anxiety which were hard to control.  She perseverated on her
medications, her course, and her dietary restrictions.  Psych
was consulted and attempted to help control these outbursts
without using benzodiazepems.  She often complained of dyspnea,
but requested ativan as treatment. She was transferred to the
MICU for low O2 saturation, where she was diuresed for
congestive heart failure/volume overload. She was transferred
back to the floor on [**6-15**], where she continued to be anxious and
take off her O2 mask. Psych recommended continuing standing
haldol as well as 100mg neurontin qhs. Benzodiazepines were
avoided. This combination had a calming effect and the patient
was significantly less agitated without being over-sedated,
thought to be back to her baseline mental status.  Remained at
baseline mental status for the rest of the hospitalization
.
2) Respiratory Compromise:
At outside hospital, patient was hypoxic to high 80's on 3L.  At
home, she requires 4L nasal canula.  Patient has history of
COPD, CHF, and pulmonary hypertension per outside notes.
Intubated on transfer and thought that congestive heart failure
contributed to hypoxemic event.  No clear pneumonia.  Patient
was aggressively diuresed via hemodialysis.  She was extubated
on [**5-7**].  Hypoxia seems out of proportion to edema
demonstrated on imaging.  TTE was negative for patent foramen
ovale.
.
On [**2167-6-1**], the patient triggered for hypoxia 68% on 6 liters
(the patient formerly had been 90-92% on 6 liters. On recheck,
the O2 sat was 88% and then 90-91% on 6 liters without
intervention. The patient was scheduled to have HD as scheduled
on [**2167-6-2**].
.
At HD, the HD catheter was noted to be nonfunctioning. TPA was
tried without success. Then, the patient was found to be hypoxic
to 75% at HD with ABG 7.53/26/44 0on a 40% venti mask.  On a
NRB, the patient's saturations improved to 97% and a repeat gas
was 7/53/27/58.
.
The patient denied any chest pain and says the shortness of
breath was not acute in onset but had been developing over the
past few days. However, her SBP was noted to be 188-216 during
HD and the patient was given her am BP meds as a result.  CXR
indicated volume overload and pt. was thought to have had acute
pulmonary edema [**1-9**] hypertension and inability to dialyze.  Pt
was transferred to MICU and had temporary femoral HD line
initially placed, then tunneled HD line placed by IR [**6-3**].  She
had 7L removed during MICU course with improvement of
oxygenation and was sent back to floor [**6-5**].
.
While on the floor she was maintained on 6L of NC.  She did
occasionally complain of dyspnea and anxiety, however it was
hard to differentiate this from her psychiatric issues, as she
was often breathing at a normal rate and sat'ing in the mid 90s
while complaining.  She generally maintained saturations from
88-95%.  She did have at least two desat's into the low 80s at
night, but responded within minutes to reassurance and haldol
without changing any pulmonary medications or oxygen.  On [**6-9**]
she had an episode of somlenence and increased confusion after
her Haldol had been increased to 2mg/dose and her NC O2 dropped
to 4L.  SHe was somlenent but arousable, and still oriented to
self  She recovered mental status quickly after a 50% venti mask
was placed, and was then seen by the MICU staff. She was
transferred again to the MICU at that point, and again was
diuresed aggressively with good result. Repeat TTE again showed
no patent foramen ovale/shunt. CTA was negative for PE.
.
She was transferred back to the floor on [**6-15**], where she
continued to required 6-8 L O2 and occasionally desat'd in
setting of anxiety. An echo [**6-19**] showed evidence of worsening
CHF (EF 30% now, was >55% in [**Month (only) **]), which would explain
continued increased oxygen requirement and SOB, with evidence of
pulmonary edema on CXR. In conjunction with the renal team, the
patient required almost daily HD or ultrafiltration to draw off
fluid. Attempts were made with medications to balance the need
for afterload reduction with supporting a blood pressure which
could tolerate volume loss through dialysis. This primarily
involved decreasing the patient's betablocker and verapamil dose
significantly, while maintaining isosorbide nitrate. The patient
was witnessed several times eating high salty foods, and being
non-compliant with the fluid restriction which complicated
attempts to manage her volume status. With aggressive HD, as
well as improved management of her anxiety and aggitation
(above) the patient gradually was weaned down to her baseline
requirement of 4L O2 on nasal cannula.
.
3) Anuric renal failure:  ATN likely from TCA/opiate overdose.
Outside hospital records revealed creatinine of 4.0 in [**Month (only) 958**]
[**2166**].  On admission, anuric.  She was hyperkalemic, so initially
received kayxelate, calcium gluconate, insulin, and
bicarbonated.  No ECG changes.  Renal ultrasound negative for
obstruction.  Received aggressive hemodialysis sessions. There
was concern that tunneled dialysis line infected, but as she was
not rigoring and did not ever develop fever or hypotension
except when on dialysis, believed that filter on hemodialysis
machine may have caused adverse reaction.  Asaghi filter used on
[**5-22**] with good effect.
.
Management of the patient's volume status was complicated by
dietary noncompliance and aggitation. After requiring 2 MICU
transfers from the floor due to decreased oxygen saturation from
pulmonary edema, we were finally able to dialyze her
sufficiently to bring her back to baseline oxygen requirement.
We monitored her intake carefully and impressed upon her the
importance of dietary compliance. Adding neurontin to her
anxiety regimen helped calm her and she became more compliant
with our management strategy and was less likely to take off her
oxygen support.  Renal recommends performing a 24 hour urine
collection after one month to re-evaluate her renal status.
.
4) Cardiovascular:
--Ischemia: History of coronary artery disease.  As outpatient,
on aspirin but no beta blocker or ace-inhibitor.  ECG without
ischemic changes and initial cardiac enzymes negative. Continued
aspirin and added beta blocker.
--Pump: Evidence of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure
on admission.  As anuric, removed excess fluid with
hemodialysis.
--Rhythm: Remained in sinus rhythm.  Started on beta blockade.
--Hypertension:  Severely elevated blood pressures.  Started
amlodipine, metoprolol, and isorbide.  Goal blood pressure <170,
but due to longstanding hypertension, developed worsened mental
status when blood pressures less than 140.  Most likely due to
hypoperfusion.  In setting of hypotensive episodes during
dialysis, held antihypertensives on mornings of dialysis. Over
the course of hospitalization, we adjusted her bp medications
according to what was tolerated during dialysis. On discharge,
she is taking isosorbide mononitrate 30mg SR and toprol XL 100mg
q day.
.
5) GI:
On admission, apparent UGI bleeding.  Coffee grounds in NGT but
this was in setting of supratherapeutic INR. Subsequently
resolved status post reversal of INR.  Treated with IV (and then
po) protonix.  Her serial hematocrits remained stable.
Abdominal CT on [**5-1**] unremarkable. Diverticulosis was noted on
subsequent abdominal CT (as above).
.
6) Infectious Disease:
On admission, received levofloxacin, but then broadened to zosyn
and vancomycin for UTI.  Completed seven day course on [**5-5**].
Shortly after discontinuation of antibiotics, was transiently
febrile, so started meropenem and vancomycin on [**5-7**] for 3 day
course.
PICC line was placed and tunneled HD line placed on [**5-13**].
Febrile shortly after line placed (1/4 bottles with staph
coagulase negative), so started ten day course of vancomycin
that was completed on [**5-23**]. New PICC placed [**6-3**] for
antibiotics and question of infection.
On [**6-17**] ID was consulted for rising leukocytosis. Bacillus
species grew from [**6-19**] PICC blood cx, pt was started on cefepime
for bacteremia on [**6-20**] (initial culture result said GNR) and
PICC was d/c'd. Was discovered on [**6-23**] that bacillus likely was
a contaminant. Pt has been afebrile, but given persistently high
WBC, there was concern for infection or other etiology. [**6-18**]
culture from HD catheter had no growtn. C. Diff was negative.
Antibiotics were discontinued on [**6-23**] given no organism isolated
and patient being afebrile. Subsequent culture from [**6-24**] showed
no growth to date. Can consider other cause of leukocytosis:
patient was not on systemic steroids so that is unlikely to be a
cause. Patient had mediastinal lymphadenopathy and lung nodules,
which could suggest a malignant cause. Recommend working up
malignancy as outpatient given that patient is clinically stable
and would benefit from rehab placement.
.
7) Depression:
On outpatient lexapro.  Restarted during hospitalization, but
discontinued, per psychiatry, on [**5-22**].
.
8) Prophylaxis:
Patient on SC heparin (was on coumadin as outpatient, but
unclear reason), lansoprazole, bowel regimen, and thiamine.
.
9) Access:
PICC placed on [**5-13**], but removed [**5-22**].  Tunneled
hemodialysis catheter placed on [**5-13**].  PICC placed [**6-3**],
removed [**6-21**].
.
10) FEN:
Initially on tubefeeds.  Speech and swallow evaluation on [**5-18**] cleared patient for thin liquids and pureed solids.
Aspiration precautions. Eventually advanced to regular renal
diet. Occasionally was hyponatremic, thought due to excess free
water ingestion.  Was kept on fluid restriction 1L/day, with
varying effect as patient would sometimes obtain water/fluids
when the nurse was not looking.
.
11) Rash:
Patient noted to have morbilliform rash on trunk and flank on
evening of [**5-25**].  Most likely result of drug reaction.
Potentially vancomycin.  Started on hydrocortisone cream, sarna
lotion, and triamcinolone cream. Resolved. Pt also noted to have
intragluteal irritation with sattelite lesions, likely yeast
infection. Started on miconazole powder.
.
12) Code:
Full.  Confirmed with daughter. (in the past patient had said
she wanted to be DNR/DNI but then reversed this).
.
Communication:
Daughter, [**Name (NI) **] - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 72819**].
.
Dispo:
To    . Has outpatient HD slot at [**Location (un) 37361**] for MWF.
