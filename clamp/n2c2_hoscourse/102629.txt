Mr. [**Known lastname 4281**] presented to the ED with chest pain. He was
appropriately medically managed and admitted for further
work-up. He underwent a cardiac cath on [**9-2**] which revealed
severe three vessel coronary artery disease. He underwent
pre-operative work-up and on [**9-5**] was brought to the operating
room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 5 (Left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and
saphenous vein grafts to diagonal ramus obtuse marginal and
posterior descending arteries). Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring intubated and sedated in stable
condition. Later this day he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one he was
started on beta-blockers/ statin/aspirin/diuretics and gently
diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. Later on this day he was
transferred to the step-down floor for further care. Physical
Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility
and cleared him safe to return to home with VNA services when
ready. He did have some abdominal pain, nausea and abdominal
distention on post operative day 4. A KUB showed marked small
bowel dilation with air-fluid levels concerning for small bowel
obstruction.  All liver function tests and amylase/ lipase were
essentially normal.  His Lasix was stopped, IVF was given and
his abdominal pain slowly resolved. Repeat KUB showed ileus.  At
the time of discharge he was ambulating without difficulty,
passing flatus and stool, tolerating a regular oral diet and his
incisions were healing well.  The remainder of his hospital
course was essentially uneventful. He continued to progress and
was cleared for discharge to home with VNA on POD 17. All follow
up appointments were advised.
