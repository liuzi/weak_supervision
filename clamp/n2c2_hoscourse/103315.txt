31 y.o. F with h/o IDDM, IVDA, cirrhosis [**1-19**] autoimmune
hepatitis c/b portal HTN w/ ascites, variceal bleed s/p TIPS on
[**2180-7-17**], and hepatic encephalopathy, presented with abd pain and
occult anemia. Hct drop from 24 to 21. PRBC transfusion was
given.  She underwent endoscopy on [**2180-9-12**] complicated by a GI
bleed when a previously placed coil in the duodenum became
dislodged. The pt's Hct dropped to 16.9 and she was taken to IR
to embolize the bleeding duodenal varix and subsequently
transferred to the CCU.

Transplant surgery was consulted and on [**2180-9-13**] she was taken to
the OR for exploratory laparotomy, ligation of duodenal varix,
duodenotomy, and retrieval of embolic coils. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was
placed. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Please refer to operative
note for details.

Postop course was complicated by high ascites drain output
requiring IV fluid replacements and albumin. Diet was slowly
advanced. Lactulose and Rifaximin were started to prevent
encephalopathy. She had high pain med requirements for
persistent abdominal pain. Drain fluid was sent for cell count
and culture on [**9-22**]. Culture of fluid isolated 2 species of
Acinetobacter Baumanii pan-sensitive except Bactrim. She was
started on Cetriaxone. Fluid was re-sent on [**9-25**] demonstrating
94 WBC and 21 polys. Culture was negative.

On postop day 13, she was re-started on Lasix and Aldactone. On
postop day 14, the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was removed. Incision and old
drain site remained dry. However, abdominal girth increased.
Creatinine started to rise.

On [**9-29**], a liver donor offer was available. Patient accepted
and underwent Liver Transplant. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Please refer to operative note for details. She was sent to SICU
immediately postop for management where she was extubated. LFTs
increased as anticipated. Liver US/Duplex demonstrated patent
arteries with resistive index in the right hepatic artery  0.7
to 0.78,  main hepatic artery was 0.78 to 0.79, and left hepatic
artery was 0.68. The middle, right, and left hepatic veins were
patent with normal waveforms. The main, right anterior, right
posterior and left portal veins are patent with normal
waveforms. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation was seen. Repeat liver duplex was unchanged. LFTs
trended down.

Creatinine continued to rise to 3.2 then decrease. Lasix was
given for generalized edema.

Diet was advanced and tolerated. Insulin gtt was initially
started then switched to sliding scale. She remained
hemodynamically stable and was transferred out of the SICU.

LFTs decreased. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and Lantus with sliding
scale ordered.  She was assisted out of bed to ambulate. Pain
medication was switched to po Dilaudid. Dose was increased for
c/o abdominal pain. Lateral JP was removed on [**10-3**] and site
sutured. This remained dry. On [**10-9**], a liver biopsy was
performed for rising alk phos. Biopsy demonstrated bile duct
proliferation. An ERCP was then done on [**10-11**] noting CBD
stricture; duct was stented. Alk phos decreased after stenting.
She tolerated the procedure fairly well. She complained of
abdominal pain and severe headache. She was also hypertensive.
This was treated with IV Lopressor and IV Morphine. Head CT was
normal. Norvasc was stopped for potential etiology of headache.
Headache and abdominal pain resolved.

Immunosuppression consisted of Cellcept which was well
tolerated, steroids were tapered per protocol. Prograf was
initiated and doses adjusted. The plan was for Prednisone to
continue permanently after taper for Autoimmune hepatitis. Lasix
was continued for 2+ leg edema. Creatinine normalized.

She was cleared by PT for home safety and was discharged to her
mother's home with VNA services. She demonstrated good knowledge
of medications and insulin management.

Of note, she experienced developed diffuse itching and burning
of the skin
and sensation of shortness of breath after eating a peanut
butter [**Location (un) 6002**].  She was given Benadryl for this and was
evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2602**] Sheik, who felt that she could have
acquired  passive transfer of food specific IgE antibodies with
a organ transplant. She was instructed to avoid all peanut
products strictly for the next month and/or until seen in
[**Hospital 9039**] Clinic in followup. Serum specific IgE to peanuts and
other common food allergens were sent, and she was given an
EpiPen script on discharge.  Administration technique was
provided. She will followup in the outpatient [**Hospital 9039**] Clinic n
two to four weeks.  Results of blood tests were to be reviewed
at that time.
