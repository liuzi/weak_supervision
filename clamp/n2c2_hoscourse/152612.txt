[**2158-11-20**] Patient admitted via ED for increasing right lower
extremity pain and swelling. S/p IVC filter placement from an
OSH complicated by right rectus muscle hematoma, s/p several
units blood transfusion. In ED found to have creatinine in 8.4,
hydrated overnight, creatinine came down to 6.8. Renal consulted
and following. RLE US showed clot in deep veins of RLE from calf
to common femoral, cannot visualize iliacs. CT of pelvis and
abd. was done-Right rectus abdominus muscle hematoma. Renal
US-showed Both kidneys show patent main renal arteries and veins
with appropriate arterial and venous waveforms. RLE was ace
wrapped and elevated. Started heparin drip conservatively. Kept
NPO. RLE noted to have significantly diminished sensation from
toes -knee with no foot motor fucntion and drop foot.

[**2158-11-21**] Patient was scheduled for angiojet thrombectomy. Kept
NPO, pre-oped and consented. Patient had abd/pelvic CT-that
showed stable rectus muscle hematoma. Became unstable, BP down
to the 70's, given fluid, blood products, transferred to the
CVICU. Arterial line and central access lines were placed for
blood pressure monitoring. Continued to be oliguric, and
creatinine remain elevated. CPKs were sent that came back
elevated. Reanl consult placed, recommended Bicarb infusion
which was started. In the CVICU patient recieved more blood
tranfusions, started on Neo drip for BP support. Angio
thrombectomy cancelled. Renal service following. Heparin drip
continued. Patient had problems w/ hyperkalemia-treated w/
Insulin/Bicarb/D50/CaGluconate IV.

[**2158-11-22**] Remained in CVICU, continued to require fluid
resucitation w/ Bicard drip and Neo drip to maintain BP.
Compartment pressures were done by ortho service-found to be
elevated, w/ CPK elevated as well. Pre-oped and consented for
open venous thrombectomy and faciotomy. Taken to OR and
underwent RLE open venous thrombectomy and fasciotomy. Patient
tolerated procedure, was transferred back to the CVICU for
recovery. Portable TTE was done-w/ LVEF >55%.

[**2158-11-23**] ICUD2/POD1: Remained Oliguric, BP remain labile
requiring pressors and fluid boluses. Continued to require blood
transfusions for low HCT. Remained intubated and sedated. Renal
following, started on Lasix drip. Started on heparin drip.
Patient had copious liquid stools-rectal tube was placed, stools
came back negative for c-diff. Noted to have increased swelling
of LE's bilateral US were done-ruled out for DVT.

12/11-13/09 ICU3-5 POD2-4: remained in the ICU, intubated and
sedatedsedated. On Lasix drip to keep UOP >100cc/h, heparin and
Bicarb drips. R lateral faciotomy w/ muscle noted to be necrotic
at superficial level. Creatinine continued to rise and started
to improve [**11-26**]. Renal following. Failed extubation [**11-25**].
Started on Cefazolin [**11-24**], added Cipro [**11-25**]. Transfused PRBCs
for low HCT.

[**11-27**] ICU6/POD5: Remained in ICU. On lasix drip and Diamox.
Started tube feeds. Remained intubated on CPAP/PS ventillation.
Remains lightly sedated on Fentanyl and Versed drips, and
continued on Heparin drip. Continued antibiotics. Renal
continued to follow.CK's and creatinine improving.Bicarb drip
discontinued. Patient's abdomen became distended and w/
vomiting, abd. x-ray showed ileus-tube feeds stopped.

[**2158-11-28**] ICU7/POD6: Patient remained in ICU, now weaned and
extubated. ARF/Rhabdo improving with hydration.Lasix drip off.
Renal signed off. PCA fentany for pain, tolerated well. Patient
found to be confused but not agitated.

[**2158-11-29**] ICU8/POD7: Remained in ICU. Maintained off ventillator.
Continued Heparin drip, started Coumadin. Now auto diuresing.
CK's and creatine continued to trend down. Physical therapy
consulted, patient taken out of bed to chair w/ a lift,
tolerated. Continue to have diarrhea w/ rectal tube. patient
reamied confused. Started PO liquids. Abdomen remain distended-
Gallbladder US-showed normal biliary ductal dilatation.

[**2158-11-30**] ICU9/POD8: Continued heparin drip, dosed with Coumadin.
Transferred to VICU [**Hospital Ward Name **] 5. Continued to be confused. Continued
to have diarrhea, priorly negative for C-diff. Tolerating PO's
but w/ poor intake.

[**2075-11-30**] POD9-16: Remained in VICU, continued to be dosed w/
Coumadin, Heparin drip came off, INR came up to 5.9 Coumadin
held for a couple days. Patient now AAOx3. Wound vac taken down
and replaced every third day. The R lateral wound was debrided
and w/ wet-dry dressing. Thigh incision dehised, dressing w/
DSD. Pain management changed to PO Dilaudid. Physical therapy
working w/ patient to get OOB. Creatinine normalized, CKs down
to the 4k, stopped cycling. HCt had been stable in the high 20's
all week.

[**Date range (1) 105490**]/10 POD17-24: Remained in the VICU. Left LLE noted to
be more swollen, unilateral US done negative for DVT. This week
patient's HCT went down to 22 from 27. Abd./pelcis CT showed
-stable R rectus sheath hematoma and w/ Minimal contraction in
the right rectus sheath hematoma. New asymmetric expansion of
the left iliopsoas muscles, with adjacent left retroperitoneal
stranding and small focal fluid collection posterior to the
inferior pole of the left kidney. Findings are compatible with
new left retroperitoneal hematoma. Patient recived numerous
blood transfusions. Heme oncology consulted-recommended to d/c
Aspirin and lower INR goal to 1.5-2.2. Aspirin was d/c'd.
Coumadin was held and res-started to target goal INR per Heme
recommendations. Kept on bedrest.

[**Date range (1) 105491**] POD 25-27: Remained in the VICU. HCT had been stable
at 29-30, transfused another unit of blood to keep HCT above 29.
Patient is stable hymodynamically. Re-started out of bed
activity. Wound vac therpay continued on R medial wound and R
groin wound. The R lateral wound was again debrided at the
bedside w/ routine wet-dry dressing found to be cellulitic all
around started Nafcillin IV. Physical therapy recommended rehab.
Rehab screening initiated.

[**2158-12-20**] POD28: Patient's HCT had been stable for almost 1 week
now, w/ almost stable Coumadin dose between 5-7.5 daily, keeping
an INR between 1.5-2.2. Patient was discharged to Rehab in
stable condition. The right LE remain to have no motor function,
sensation is almost normal w/ new cellulitis around the lateral
faciotomy, now being treated w/antibiotics. Patient's PO intake
remain poor but improving. Her creatinine is now normal. Patient
will FU w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in 2 weeks to re-evaluate wounds and
