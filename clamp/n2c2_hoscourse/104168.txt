Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after complaints of nausea,
vomiting, and not "feeling herself".  Of significance, she is
status post diagnosis of lung mass for which she was being
worked up on an outpatient basis.
.
1. NSCLC, metastatic to brain/nausea/vomiting/headache -- Upon
admission a head CT was performed which identified multiple
infra and supra tentorial brain lesions, including the brain
stem.  High dose steroid therapy was initiated to treat
associated vasogenic edema.  A left stereotactic brain biopsy
was performed on [**5-30**].  Post-operatively a head CT was done, and
determined to be stable.  She was then returned to the ICU
pending diagnosis and further management.  She was initiated on
whole brain radiation on [**2184-6-2**] and was monitored in the ICU
for signs and symptoms of increased ICP.  She was subsequently
transferred to the hospitalist service for the remainder of her
course.
During initiation of her brain radiation treatments, patient had
intractable nausea, vomiting, headache, and hypertension, but
repeat CT head did not show increased edema.  She continued on
IV dexamethasone 6 mg q6 hours, IV keppra 1000mg q12 hours, and
IV hydralazine for blood pressure control (see below).
For nausea control, she was kept on compazine, zofran, ativan,
phenergen PRN.
Oncology, neuro-oncology, and neurosurgery was involved
throughout her hospital course.  Her symptoms gradually subsided
and she was transitioned to po meds.  She will complete the
remainder of her radiation treatments as an outpatient.  She has
follow up scheduled with thorcaic oncology and neuro-oncology.
.
2. Hypertension -- While unable to tolerate po, she was treated
with IV hydralazine for goal SBP of less than 130 mmHg.  When
able to tolerate po, she was transitioned to Lisinopril.  The
patient was instructed to followup with her PCP regarding her
blood pressure.
.
3. Asthma -- remained stable throughout her course, continued
prn albuterol.
.
4. Hyperglycemia -- associated with high dose steroids and
managed with a sliding scale without difficulty.
.
5. Dispo:  The patient ambulated without difficulty and was
discharged home in stable conition.
