69 y.o. F h/o CAD s/p multiple stents, ischemic CM EF 25%,
asthma, multiple recent admissions (most recently [**Date range (1) 27916**] to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for fall and hypoglycemia thought [**2-21**] insulin use in the
setting of ARF; previously [**Date range (1) 107613**] c respiratory failure
thought [**2-21**] COPD and CHF. found by her VNA to hypoxic to 80's on
RA.  Upon arrival to the ED VS= 86% on ra, HR 100, BP 155/59, RR
32.

She was treated for COPD flare (steroids), CHF (bipap, lasix,
nitro gtt), and PNA (levaquin).  CTA not performed [**2-21**] inability
to lie flat, but pt empirically started on heparin gtt.  Her
oxygen status improved and she was transferred to the MICU.

In the MICU, pt's antibiotic coverage was broadened to CTX/vanco
and azithromycin.  In the setting of her first azithromycin dose
on [**6-6**], pt became hypotensive requiring pressors (levo, neo,
vaso), felt to be an allergic reaction to the azithromycin.
Pressors were titrated off ~12 hrs later on [**6-7**].  Her
respiratory status continued to improve, and she was weaned of
bipap on [**6-7**], and steroids were discontinued as COPD was felt
less likely.

On [**6-7**] pt's HCT 31->24, she was transfused 1U PRBC, complicated
by grand mal seizure, and hypotension, again requiring pressors
(levo, neo, vaso) for ~12hrs.  Neuro was consulted as there was
also a question of left dilated pupil, head CT showed no acute
bleeding, +subacute/chronic infarctions, EEG c/w toxic/metabolic
insult, heparin gtt was held.  CTA was obtained which showed
very small left apical PE, felt unlikely to account for
hypotension.  TTE revealed EF=20% (old), 2+mr, 3+tr.

On [**6-9**], repeat blood transfusion performed without
complication.  HCT 21->26, however hemolysis labs revealed
hapto<20, LDH 760->468, smear +schistocytes, suggestive of
hemolysis, DAT negative x 2 ([**6-8**], [**6-9**]).  Per report, pt's
mental status (which waxes and wanes), is not far from her
baseline.  She responds to voice, but is a&ox1 (name) only.

On [**6-10**] O2 and BP were stable and pt was transferred to the
floor.  On the Floor she completed her course of Vanc/Cefepime.
Her BP stabilized and she was restarted on home antihypertensive
regimen.  Fingersticks remained elevated, and her glargine was
increased for better glycemic control.  She continued on
albuterol and atrovent prn for shortness of breath/wheezing.
Heme/onc was consulted regarding hemolysis and anticoagulation.
Their recommendations stated that the exact cause of hemolysis
is difficult to interpret, however by the time the pt was on the
floor, the hct was rising and LDH was falling suggesting that
hemolysis was resolving.  They recommended that there was no
contraindication to anticoagulation.  Given her multiple
indications for anticoagulation, decision was made to begin
coumadin with a lovenox bridge. Her INR was 1.9 on discharge,
and she will continue on lovenox SQ until INR therapeutic at 2-3
and coumadin 10 mg daily.  The lovenox may be stopped after
therapeutic INR.  INRs should be followed and her dose adjusted
accordingly.
