41 year old gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell
lymphoma (s/p admission at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**])
who was transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] following episode
of altered mental status early on day of admission, [**12-24**], that
led to intubation for airway protection.

#. Lymphoma: He initially presented to [**Hospital6 5016**] with
nausea and vomiting.  On admission here, an LP was done that
showed a high opening pressure (49) and multiple atypical cells
concerning for recurrent CNS lymphoma.  He was started on
high-dose Decadron and was followed by Medical Oncology,
Neuro-oncology, and Radiation Oncology.  His presenting symptoms
were considered a consequence of his worsening lymphoma.  Given
his previous treatments with intrathecal chemotherapy, he was
not considered a candidate for chemotherapy.  He began
palliative full brain XRT on [**2144-12-28**].  His clinical condition
deteriorated and his respiratory status worsened and he was only
able to have one treatment. On [**2144-12-29**] a discussion with the
health care proxy led to Mr. [**Known lastname **] being made comfort measures
only.  He died on [**2144-12-31**] at 4:40pm.

#. Altered mental status:  His AMS was most likely caused by
recurrent CNS lymphoma and increased intracranial pressure.  He
was initially treated with Acyclovir for HSV, however this was
stopped due to low clinical suspicion. His mental status did not
improve off sedation.  His mental status deteriorated to the
point where he was not responsive, likely related to his CNS
lymphoma and increased ICP.

#. Endotracheal intubation/extubation: He was intubated for
airway protection at an OSH prior to admission.  He
self-extubated two days after admission without complication.
He remained off ventilatory support and became hypoxic three
days prior to death but was made comfort measures only.

#. Pneumonia: At admission, he spiked a temperature, had copious
secretions and a consolidation in the RUL on chest x-ray.
Vancomycin and Cefepime were started on [**12-25**] for a planned 8
day course, which was stopped early when the goals of care were
changed.

#. Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma:  He had a history of a
pituitary adenoma and surgical resection had been planned for
future.  This was deferred due to his poor clinical status.

#. Sacral decubitus ulcer:  He had a stage IV sacral ulcer with
recent pseudomonal infection. It appeared uninfected on
admission and was followed by the wound care team.

#. Code Status: He was initially full code during this
hospitalization, but after he clinically worsened with severe
alteration in mental status, he was made DNR/DNI and eventually
comfort measures only.
