This is a 52 y.o. HIV positive male ([**2192-9-11**]: CD4 72,
VL>100,000) with a 6 week history of diarrhea and low-grade temp
who was initially admitted to the MICU for hypotension and ARF,
improved after volume resuscitation.
.
# Diarrhea. Likely the patient was hypotensive and in renal
failure secondary to hypovolemia precipitating ARF. The patient
had a small amount of outpatient work-up for this, negative to
date, including: Stool C. Diff, culture and CMV viral load
undetectable. The patient was given symptomatic treatment,
including imodium and his diarrhea improved dramatically. He was
unable to provide a stool sample while on the floor. The patient
was given a prescription for an outpatient stool sample for
repeat stool culture (including viral and bacterial), DFA for
crytosporidium and giardia, ova & parasites, microsporidium. The
GI team was consulted on  the patient. It was their
recommendation that the patient have an infectious work-up. If
negative and diarrhea persists, the patient should have a
colonoscopy at a later date when aspirin and plavix can be held
(at least 9 months from the time of drug eluting stent
placement. At the time of discharge, the patient's diarrhea was
well-controlled with loperamide and the patient was tolerating
fluids PO. He was encouraged to have aggressive PO fluid intake
whenever diarrhea occurs.
.
# Fevers. The patient had a low-grade (100) fever after coming
to the floor from the MICU. This may be secondary to the same
process as the diarrhea. However, the patient has poorly
controlled HIV and therefore is at risk for numerous sources.
Empiric antibiotics were deferred as no source of infection was
found.
.
# Hypotension. Likely secondary to persistent diarrhea. The
patient was aggressively hydrated with IV NS in the MICU. He
came to the floor normotensive and maintained this volume status
for the remainder of his time in the hospital.
.
# Acute renal failure. Likely pre-renal secondary to persistent
diarrhea and volume depletion. The patient's Cr improved to
normal range after volume resuscitation.
.
# Chest pain. The patient had a CTA that was negative for PE. He
had a slight troponin elevation thought consistent with demand
ischemia in the setting of hypotension and poor troponin
excretion in the setting of renal failure. The patient's
troponin trended downward throughout his admission and he never
showed CK elevations.
.
# CAD. No signs of acute ischemia. Troponin leak with normal CK
likely secondary to demand ischemia and ARF. The patient was
continued on ASA, plavix, beta blocker, statin. His ACEi was
held for renal failure and then restarted prior to discharge. On
echo, the patient had new mechanical dysfunction. The patient
should have outpatient p-MIBI to assess for perfusion deficits.
.
# HIV. On [**2192-9-11**], CD4 72, VL>100,000. The patient's HAART has
been held while in the MICU for renal failure. These medications
were restarted prior to discharge. The patient's PCP will
consider initiating prophylactic antibiotics as an outpatient.
.
# Anemia. Patient's baseline appears 29-30. Patient with drop in
Hct likely in part secondary to dilution. The patient had guaiac
positive stool with known abnormal colonoscopy and EGD in past
is concerning for GI bleed. The patient had multiple units of
blood transfusion while in the MICU. His Hct normalized prior to
discharge.
.
# Thrombocytopenia. The patient's platelets declined to 90 while
in the MICU and he was found to be HIT antibody positive.
Heparin products were held and the patient's platelet count
stabilized.
