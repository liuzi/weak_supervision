A/P: 87 y/o F with h/o of NSCLC p/w malaise and abdominal pain,
found to be hyponatremic.
.
Malaise: Pt much improved after IVF. Suspect combination
hyponatremia, hypothyroid, poor po intake, and chemotherapy
(Navelbine). EKG with non-specific changes, pt refuses
telemonitor and negative CE x 3. [**Last Name (LF) 96963**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] manage
hyponatremia and hypothyroid as below.
.
#.Hyponatremia: The patient appeared hypovolemic on admission
with a sodium of 127 and a serum osm of 282. The patient was
given 1L of NS and corrected to 133.  The patient was given
another liter of NS throughout the day.  The patient was stable
and w/o mental status changes.  Throughout the evening the
patient continued to urinate frequently.  On [**6-27**] the repeat
morning sodium was 120 and a serum osm of 256.  The patients
history of lung cancer and hypothyroid make SIADH the likely
cause of her hyponatermia.  The patient was placed on 750ml
fluid restriction and lytes were checked TID, her Na dipped to
117 but then increased to 120-122 with fluid restriction to
500ml.  She was then made NPO and her UO dropped to 60ml in 12
hours but her Na remained at 120, she triggered for blood
pressure to 80s/50s and she was transferred to the ICU for

patient would intermittently tolerate small amounts of po
intake.  The patient was sent for an abdominal U/S to evaluate
her celiac stent which showed decreased velocity from previous
study.  Additionally, a guaic stool was sent as well as LFTs and
Hct, which were within normal limits.  [**Month/Year (2) **] surgery was
consulted and they felt that mesenteric ischemia was very
unlikely.
#Hypothyroid: Pt TSH was 6.1.  Pt admits to non-compliance of
levothyroxine.  Pt was educated on hypothyroid and importance of
med compliance.
