Hospital Course: 68 year old man with a history of coronary
disease status post cabg in [**2107**] and multiple PCIs, DM type II,
hypertension and depression who presented initially on [**2120-7-7**]
with weight gain at home and altered mental status.  He had what
appeared to be a possible seizure in the ED, resulting in
dilantin loading and subsequent hypotension requiring transfer
to the MICU. He was then sent to the medicine service for
several days while work up continued on his neurologic issues
and falls (work up negative). Then on [**2120-7-11**], he began having
chest pain, and echo showed new acute decrease in the EF from
45->20% with some apical and septal akinesis. Cath the following
day showed severe native disease with 2 BMS placed in RCA, and
RHC showed elevated wedge at 30mmHg. He was intitially
transferred back to the cardiology service for management,
however he became increasingly volume overloaded with end organ
dysfunction (renal and liver failure) suggestive of cardiogenic
shock, necessitating transfer to the CCU under the heart failure
service.
.
CCU Course:  On arrival patient was started on inotropes,
pulmonary artery catheter was placed, and intra-aortic balloon
pump was initiated for support for his cardiogenic shock.  Given
his renal failure, CVVH was initiated (mostly for
ultrafiltration).  Despite full support with intermittent
pressors, IABP, and CVVH, he failed to improve.  On [**2120-7-17**], he
self-discontinued his balloon pump, leading to rapid
decompensation necessitating urgent intubation and transfer to
the cath lab for IABP re-placement.  He was able to wean off the
balloon pump on [**2120-7-19**], however his hemodynamics then worsened
again, necessitating the use of pressors.  Despite full pressor
support, his status continued to worsen.  Upon frank discussion
with his family regarding his grim prognosis, they felt that he
would never want to continue with aggressive care if there was
little chance of full recovery.  On [**2120-7-21**], they decided to
transition his care to comfort measures only.  He died
peacefully on [**2120-7-22**].

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# [**Date Range 7792**]/Cardiogenic Shock: On [**2120-7-11**] while on medicine
service, experienced chest pain with troponin of 0.1, negative
MB, but echo with new anterior WMA and EF depressed at 25% (down
from 40-45%).  Cath on [**7-12**] showed 80% ostial stenosis of the
RCA, which was stented with 2 bare metal stents.  Following the
cath, he continued to decompensate.  He appeared to be in
decompensated CHF by renal status, crackles on exam, and mild
peripheral edema.  A TTE showed an EF of 20% from baseline of
40-45% in 6/[**2118**].  He had 2 BMS placed to his RCA, his LVEDP was
elevatd at 30, pulmonary pressures were also elevated so the
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service. Despite aggresive
diuresis, patient continued to [**Last Name (un) 22977**] clinically, with high
filling pressures, low CI, low UOP and was transfered to CCU.
Patient was started on dobutamine for inotropic effect (could
not do milranone because of [**Last Name (un) **]). He was also on lasix drip.
Patient had an intra-aortic baloon pump to improve systemic
perfusion and coronary artery perfusion.
.
While in CCU a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to monitor CO.
Dobutamine drip was started in setting of low CO. The patient
was also started on CVVH to remove fluid thought to be
contributing to decreased CO as renal failure persisted. On [**7-17**]
pt was increasingly delusional and removed his IABP partially.
Decision was made to remove pump at this time and heparin ggt
d/c and pressure held at site. The patient's o2 sats decreased
at this time and lactate increased to over 6. Decision was made
to intubate and transfer to cath lab for replacement of pump.
Ballon pump was weaned off of IABP on [**7-19**]. Howver he conintued
to have high pressor requirements.
.
#.Acute on Chronic [**Last Name (un) **]: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.5, on
admission 2.2.  However after the drop in his blood pressure and
after his cath his Cr continued to rise and he stopped making
urine.  Renal was consulted who started CCVH to remove fluid to
help relieve strain on his heart.  CCVH was stopped when patient
was made CMO by family on [**7-21**].
.
#Transaminitis - On transfer to [**Hospital1 1516**] service, patients LFTs had
noted to increase to ALT 117, AST 418.  The day following cath,
his LFTs sharply rose to ALT 1200 and AST 1059, LDH 1900, TBili
1.9.  Concern was for shock liver vs med effect, Hepatology was
consulted who felt this was due to shock liver - they rec'd to
hold atorvastatin, obtain RUQ U/S which showed possibly fatty
liver with patent vasculature.  The following day, he developed
encephalopathy and lactulose was started. LFTs trended down
throughout his hospital course.
.
#.Fall at Home- His initial insult was a well-described
mechanical fall from slipping on mineral oil, and he did not
endorse symptoms consistent with vasovagal syncope. We also
considered orthostasis given history of same vs. arrhythmia vs.
seizure given possible seizure in CT scan. Patient was not found
to be orthostatic. Neurology consulted and had a low suspicion
of seizure. MRI with and without contrast was unremarkable.
Neurology continued to follow and did not recommend AED's.
.
IDDM: Patient was kep on insulin sliding scale and hi blood
surgars well well ontrolled in the CCU.
.
Goals of Care dicussion: On [**7-21**]: Family meeting was held with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]??????[**Doctor Last Name **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4402**], SW [**Doctor First Name **], and patient??????s family
including:  wife [**Name (NI) **], daughter [**Name (NI) 12983**], daughter [**Name (NI) 22978**], and
sister [**Name (NI) **].  They were updated on the patient??????s grim
prognosis and his continued decline despite maximal support.
The family was in agreement that per past discussions they had
with the patient, he would not have wanted a prolonged death and
would rather be made comfortable at this juncture.  In light of
this, Mr [**Known lastname **]??????s goal of care was focused on comfort only, with
cessation of all supportive measures including pressors, CVVH,
and the ventilator. After withdawal of all care he passed away
on [**2120-7-22**] at 7:10am.
