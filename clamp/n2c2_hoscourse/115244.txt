  1. Upper GI bleed:  EGD performed on
[**2168-4-18**] revealed a normal EGD to the second part of the
duodenum.  In the second part of the duodenum a fresh clot
located between the duodenal bulb and the ampulla was noted.
After washings there was fresh bleeding that completely
obscured visualization.  Despite multiple attempts of
washings, therapeutic cautery was impossible with EGD.  Given
the brisk bleeding, an emergent artery embolization was
needed.  Interventional radiology performed an embolization
of the gastroduodenal artery and noted a pseudoaneurysm at
the entrance into the duodenum.  This was performed on
[**2168-4-18**].  The patient's hematocrit reached a nadir of 13.9
on [**2168-4-18**] and required six units of packed red blood cells
for resuscitation.  Following the embolization described
above the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit
remained stable at approximately 28.  The patient's diet was
advanced slowly 48 hours following the procedure without
complications.  Serial examinations were performed to
evaluate for ischemic colitis which revealed a completely
benign abdomen.

Gastroenterology followed the patient during the course of
admission and made several recommendations to decrease future
risks of GI bleeding, including Protonix b.i.d. for at least
two weeks and then continued q.d. thereafter, avoidance of
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Omega oils,
avoidance of alcohol and avoidance of coffee.

Prior to discharge, a repeat endoscopy was done to reevaluate
the region of active bleeding.  This was performed on
[**2168-4-21**] and revealed a shallow ulcer in the second part of
the duodenum.  Per gastroenterology, this region is stable
and the patient does not require further follow up from their
department unless there are signs of recurrent bleeding, such
as presyncope, bloody stools, melena, or hemodynamically
instability.  Helicobacter pylori was negative.

2. Chest pain:  The patient had the band-like chest pain on
presentation that was typical of his chronic pain.  The
patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction.  He had a
normal EKG.  Pain resolved with treatment of upper GI bleed
and with Ultram.

3. Back pain:  The patient was initiated on a treatment plan
with Ultram as an alternative to ibuprofen for chronic back
pain.  The patient states that he gained adequate relief with
this regimen and did not find any significant side effects in
the first few days to use.  He will be discharged with a
prescription for Ultram.  Tylenol may also be used.
