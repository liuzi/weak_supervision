85 M with h/o CVA s/p recent CEA, DM2, CKD and HTN who presented
with hypoxic respiratory distress [**1-4**] PNA and new-onset AFib
with RVR.
.
# Pneumonia: Multifocal PNA, treated for aspiration and HAP
given recent intubation / hospital stay with vanc/levo/flagyl x
11 days, vanc/zosyn/flagyl x 2 days, vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/flagyl x 4 days.
LENIs negative, V/Q scan intermediate probability PE. Pulm
consulted but rec no bronch as respiratory status improved. He
was taken off antibiotics x 2 days and spiked fever, tachypnic,
WBC increased from 10 -> 22 (C. diff negative), then decreased
11 after starting linezolid and levofloxacin (to complete 14 day
course on [**1-1**]). Respiratory status improved with diminished O2
requirement and resolution of tachypnea. Followup with PCP.
.
# Personality change: ?depression vs. frontal disinhibition.
Patient had been expressing wishes to die intermittently.
Occasional sundowning. Psych and neuro consulted. CT head shows
resorbed subdural hematoma, MR brain negative for acute CVA. EEG
was normal with no seizure activity. Intermittenly uncooperative
and somnolent, then spontaneously A&Ox3; likely [**1-4**] delerium
from toxic-metabolic cause in setting of significant frontal
atrophy noted on head CT. Tried on ritalin (d/c'd [**1-4**] concern
for MS change), celexa (d/c'd [**1-4**] concern for hypotension), and
remeron (d/c'd [**1-4**] concern for MS change, risk of serotonin
syndrome while on linezolid). Occasionally the patient developed
non-threatening hallucinations thought to be [**1-4**] toxic-metabolic
causes. If he develops agitation, psych recommends considering a
trial of haldol 0.5mg prn.
.
# Paroxysmal AFib: RVR to 140's at presentation, started on dilt
drip while in the ED, which was then weaned off in MICU.
Remained in sinus rhythm the rest of hospital course. No prior
h/o AFib per patient (confirmed with PCP). CHADS score 3, and
therefore would probably benefit from anticoagulation, but given
fall risk, recent SDH, comorbidites this was deferred (discussed
with PCP). Monitored on telemetry with no repeat events.
Continued metoprolol with good BP control; occasionally sinus
tachy likely [**1-4**] volume depleteion, stress, and infection.
.
# ARF on CRF: Resolved. Baseline Cre ~2.2; was 2.0 at discharge.
Most likely pre-renal azotemia in setting of hypovolemia (poor
intake, diarrhea) and responded to IVFs. Medications were
renally dosed.
.
# DM2: Diet-controlled. Hypoglycemic on transfer to MICU in
setting of starting NPH for persistant hyperglycemia; NPH was
then discontinued. Fingersticks were eventually discontinued as
serum glucose was well-controlled.
.
# CVA: s/p CEA, stable (followed by [**Doctor Last Name 1391**]). MR brain negative
for acute event. Vascular surgery made aware patient admitted,
no active issues. Cont ASA, Aggrenox.
.
# Cardiovascular: No documented h/o CAD or CHF but multiple risk
factors. Preserved EF on echo, although possible diastolic
dysfunction. CXR after MICU transfer with mild to moderate
volume overload and the patient was gently diuresed until
euvolemic. Cont ASA, statin, BB.
.
# Anemia: OB +ve stool noted while patient was in MICU, and then
intermittent positivity during rest of hospital stay.
?gastritis. Received 1 unit pRBC during admission with
appropriate increase in Hct, which remained stable. Started on
PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Recent c-scope (2 years ago per patient) negative;
denies ever having EGD or h/o GI bleeding. Would consider
pursuing outpatient GI followup.
.
# Coagulopathy: Elevated INR 1.4-1.5 at presentation likely
nutritional given poor PO intake. LFTs normal and
albumin/prealbumin low supporting nutritional deficiency.
Received vitamin K PO with slight improvement.
.
# Rash: Likely drug reaction [**1-4**] zosyn as this was only new
recent medication around the time the rash began. Serum eos
normal. The rash resolved after 1 week. Mild pruritis was
well-controlled with topical anti-itch cream.
.
# Hypernatremia: Resolved. Hypovolemic at presentation (~3.5L
H2O deficit), serum Na+ normalized with free water boluses but
recurred when stopped from poor PO intake and again improved
with free water (3L deficit). PO intake encouraged.
.
# Hypotension: Resolved after 8L of fluids in MICU. Likely [**1-4**]
hypovolemia from poor PO intake and diarrhea. Diarrhea also
resolved (C. diff neg x 3). Continued to supplement with IV
hydration and intermittent hypodermoclysis given poor POs.
.
# Hyperthyroidism: Mild with slighlty elevated free T4, slightly
depressed TSH. No thyroid nodules on exam. Difficult to
interpret in acute care setting, and therefore would suggest
rechecking as outpatient.
.
# Activity: PT worked with patient frequently. Goal OOB to chair
daily. Will likely need significant rehabilitation and will
benefit greatly from increased mobility and independence.
.
# FEN: Prethickened liquids / ground solids, PO intake
encouraged; Briefly with NG tube on tube feeds but d/c'd
according to family wishes due to somnolence and mental status
changes; Continue aspiration precautions; Repleted 'lytes prn
