Ms. [**Known lastname 3924**] is a 34 yo F w/ extensive PMH included right lung
hypoplasia and multiple tracheostomy tubes with subsequent
tracheomalacia and subglotic stenosis who presented for an
outpatient elective rigid bronchoscopy with ballon dilation that
was complicated on extubation by likely laryngospasm with
stridor and reintubation who was reextubated successfully.

#Tracheo-bronchial atresia and Laryngospasm- patient had
striodor and respiratory distress following extubation from the
balloon dilation. A flexible bronchoscopy done in the PACU
showed some subglottic edema and the stenosis was patent.  She
was reintubated and admitted to the ICU.  There she received a
RIJ central line for access and ENT was consulted who performed
a fiberopstic evaluation where they did not see any evidence of
stenosis and it was felt to be most consistent with
laryngospasm.  She was treated with 24 hours of decadron and
then successfully extubated.  She was monitored by IP and will
require follow-up with them in the future to reassess her
hoarseness.
