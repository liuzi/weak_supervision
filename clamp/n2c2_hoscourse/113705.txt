HOSPITAL COURSE
Ms. [**Known lastname 92380**] is a 66 year old woman with ESRD on PD, NSCLC, anemia,
and thyroid cancer who presented with an upper GI bleed. She
required multiple transfusions and transfer to the MICU where
upper endoscopy revealed bleeding gastric ulcers secondary to
recent NSAID use.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Gastric Ulcers with Bleeding,
Duodenitis:
Symptomatic anemia in the setting of a significant drop in Hct
over a three day period. (36->27->22) Etiology initially
concerning for discontinuation of weekly epogen in setting of
elevated hmg on routine lab draw.  The patient has past history
of dramatic hct drop off epo. She received 1x dose of tordol
during ED visit on Monday. No other NSAID use or history of
GERD. Most recent colonscopy in [**2146**] demonstrated multiple
polyps. Follow up colonoscopy deferred given NSCLC. Initially no
evidence of acute bleed, guaic negative stool in the ED prior to
transfer, however on the morning of admission the patient passed
four melanolic stool, guaic positive.  Her hct dropped to 22,
she was transfused 1 unit of pRBC and given desmopressin. Two
PIVs were placed, she was started on PPI gtt and 1 more unit
pRBC and transferred to MICU for EDG and further management. EGD
revealed multiple gastric ulcers in antrum, one of which had
stigmata of recent bleed with overlying dark area. This area was
injected.  There was no evidence of active bleeding.  The
duodenal bulb was acutely inflammed and edematous w/o discrete
ulcer or bleeding.  Patient received additional 2 units pRBCS
after procedure, with subsequent stabilization in HCT and
hemodynamics.  Her diet was advanced to clears, and she was
stable to be transferred back to the general medicine floor.
Her hematocrit continued to be stable.  Pantoprazole was changed
to PO BID dosing which she will continue on for 6 weeks.  She
will discuss further epoitin dosing with her outpatient
nephrologist. Hpylori negative. IgA at normal levels.

# Flank Pain:
The patient has was admitted to the ED prior to admission for
left sided plank pain for which she was prescribed vicodin for
pain managment. An episode of this flank pain recurred on
admission.  Physical exam demonstrated left flank tenderness to
palpation. CT abdomen on [**2-13**] demonstrated bilateral stones and
CT abdomen two days later demonstrated calcified atrophic
kidneys.  Unclear if pain is secondary to stones as patient is
PD dependant and almost anuric. Would consider outpatient MRI to
investigate for nerve impingement.  Her pain was treated with
vicodin.

# Abdominal Pain Diffuse:
Completely resolved in setting of large bowel movement on night
of admission. She was afebrile, but given her history of
peritonitis and PD, fluid sent for culture and gram stain.  Gram
stain revealed 1+ polys and no microorganisms, culture was
negative. Blood cultures were negative at the time of discharge.


# ESRD:
Renal fellow contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding admission. Peritoneal dialysis
was started per home regimen. Epoetin dosing to be discussed
with outpatient nephrologist. The patient became mildly fluid
overloaded in setting of multiple transfusions and clear diet.
CXR demonstrated small pleural effusion. Her PD dialsylate was
adjusted as indicated.

# Hyperkalemia:
Hyperkalemic on admission. She received kayexalate with
improvement in her potassium.  No peaked T waves.

# Hypothyroidism:
Continued home levothyroxine dose.

# NSCLC: On Tarceva every three days. Patient stated she will
not take until appetite improved.  Heme/onc was called, and
placed orders for patient to continue on Tarceva as per home
regimen.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
Medical Management: Pantoprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **] for 6 weeks, Vicodin
for 3 days
Code Status: Full (Was DNR but do Intubate on admission.)
