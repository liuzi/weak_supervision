86y F with atrial flutter and recently worsening dementia
(undiagnosed), who was not taking anti-coagulation for her afib,
recently s/p right Femur repair [**2147-12-20**]. Returned from Rehab
to our ED as a code stroke due to Left-sided weakness, and was
found to have a Right-M2 (superior division) occlusion,
presumably due to cardioembolic clot given her aflutter without
A/C. Given IV-tPA in the ED, with some improvement in her LUE
(anti-gravity strength), but this was c/b a large and painful
hematoma in the region of her recent surgery, which required
that she go to OR urgently with Orthopedics for fasciotomy to
relieve pressure from compartment syndrome (70mmHg pressure
measured by Ortho). Her H&H dropped, but improved appopriately
after transfusion of 2U PRBCs. Her family decided to stop
pursuing aggressive care measures; fasciotomy and transfusion
were performed due to their palliative value (pt. in severe pain
from pressure/compartment syndrome). Pt was made CMO by family
and transferred to the floor, with removal of tubes, lines, and
invasive interventions and testing measures. She remained
comfortable, but minimally responsive, with PRN sublingual
morphine and with scopolamine patch. She died [**2147-1-16**].
