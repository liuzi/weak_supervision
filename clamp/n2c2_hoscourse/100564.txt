43 yo male with hx of rectal CA, DMII, and histoplasmosis now
presents with SVC partial thrombosis now admitted to ICU for
thrombolysis.
.
1. SVC thrombosis-The patient initially presented with vague
chest, shoulder and arm pain. Also, his port was not functioning
well. A subsequent port study showed clot diffuse peri-catheter
thrombus including thrombus beyond the distal tip, no antegrade
flow from the port into the superior vena cava. He may be
hypercoagulable  due to CA. We initially infused tpa at 1mg/hr
for 8 hours followed by another 8 hours of 1/2mg/hr, per IR
protocol. However a subsequent port study showed persistance of
the clot. TPA was stopped. Surgery was consulted and a decision
was made to remove the port. He tolerated the procedure well and
was started on lovenox post-op.

2. Rectal CA-Pt not yet staged. Pt. will continue with continue
XRT as an outpatient. His 5-fu was changed to Xeloda per
HemeOnc. Will hold on XRT per Rad Onc while managing thrombosis
issue.
.
3. DMII- We held glyburide while he was NPO and maintained on a
RISS. His glyburide was restarted after his procedure.

4. Diarrhea- likely related to 5FU. Resolved during his stay.
