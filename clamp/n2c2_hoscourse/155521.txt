Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 29-year-old man with severe hypertension. He
has undergone work-up by his primary care doctor, a renal
physician and cardiology, without known cause. Hypertension
appears to be familial, present in his father and sister, both
from a young age. It is possible that whatever underlying
predisposition he has is inherited in an autosomally dominant
fashion, although this cannot be concluded given our limited
knowledge of his pedigree. Further outpatient work-up seems
warranted.

There was no underlying vascular malformation or other lesion
from which this hemorrhage has arisen, at least at the
resolution of CT. His compliance has been good but imperfect, so
we think that his hemorrhage was most likely hypertensive during
the exertions of sexual activity. As such, a primary goal has
been to control his blood pressure, which is now quite adequate.


The hemorrhage was in the basis pontis on the left, with
apparent vasogenic edema of the overlying tegmentum. Although
there is not frank hemorrhage into the midline pontine
tegmentum, edema and mass effect in this area most likely
accounts for drowsiness. He initially demonstrated Troemner's
and Babinksi's signs on the left, suggesting some mass effect to
the right basis pontis, but this is now resolved. Eye movement
abnormality is partially explained by lesion of the tract of the
sixth nucleus, with nuclear sparing. In addition, adbuction to
the right is incomplete and the reason for this is only
speculative. He demonstrates loss of voluntary cough and
swallow, with preservation of brisk involuntary cough, likely
due to the effect of the lesion on the dorsal midline portion of
basis pontis, with preserved nucleus ambiguus and lateral
medulla.

Drowsiness resulted in intubation while at the scanner after
arrival at the ED. He was extubated successfully on [**2105-4-28**], with
some difficult managing secretion, but not oxygenation.

When extubated and with controlled pressure he was transferred
to the neurology step-down unit. Atenolol was stopped and
replaced with metoprolol tartrate given better 24 hour coverage
and conversion to the succinate salt is intended at discharge.

After PEG placement he had desaturations to the low 80s and was
sent back to the ICU. His CXR showed low lung volumes and the
etiology was thought to be from the abdominal binder and
restrictive lung disease. He was able to be weaned to trach mask
with low O2 requirements and sent back to the floor. His blood
pressure was stable for 48 hours prior to discharge in the
120s-130s systolic.

He will follow up in clinic with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
