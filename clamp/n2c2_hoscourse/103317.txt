The patient was admitted to the Blue surgery service and
underwent an emergent operation on [**2156-7-27**] (see Dr.[**Name (NI) 11471**] op
note). Postoperatively, her wound healed secondarily with wet to
dry dressing changes twice daily. She underwent CT-guided
drainage of a pelvic abscess with placement of a pigtail
catheter. A G tube and JP drain were also placed. She was
administered antibiotics for organisms isolated from her wound
cultures. One week [**Last Name (LF) **], [**Known firstname 17**] developed a fever/rash and
renal failure thought to be a reaction to an antibiotic, most
likely Zosyn. She also developed a severe skin rash and was
briefly transferred to the SICU for fluid resuscitation. She
recovered from the drug reaction, was transferred back to the
floor. Repeat CT scans of her abdomen showed no new collections,
and she continued to improve. The JP drain was removed on [**8-31**].
She was deemed ready for discharge to rehab on [**9-3**].
