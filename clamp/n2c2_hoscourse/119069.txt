1. Astrocytoma:
The CT of his demonstrated increasing midline shift along with
increasing edema likely accounting for the majority of his
symptoms.  Steroid dose had been tapered recently given the
patient's steroid myopathy.  Given this, he was given 10 mg IV
decadrom in the emergency room with continuation of IV steroids
thereafter.

He was seen by neurosurgery and taken to the OR on [**2172-4-21**] for
left temporal craniotomy for tumor debulking.  There were no
intraoperative or postoperative complications.  The patient was
taken to the trauma ICU overnight for close monitoring of his
neuro status and blood pressure.  PRN hydralazine was used to
keep SBP<140.  A repeat CT showed "interval decompression and
improvement in the amount of mass effect, midline shift,
subfalcine herniation, and effacement of the left suprasellar
and ambient cisterns" and the patient remained without headache
or nausea/vomiting.  His speach aphasic and his right-sided
weakness was stable to mildly improved.  He was seen by physical
and occupational therapy and they felt he would benefit from
rehab.

At the time of discharge, the plan was for:
- Continued dexamethasone, with taper
- Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] on [**5-5**] for chemotherapy
- Monitoring of mental status
- Metoprolol was started for blood pressure control

2. Steroid Myopathy:
Patient had a history of steroid induced myopathy and had
presented with an ongoing steroid taper.  Given the amount of
edema seen and the symptoms secondary to this, steroids were
increased at the time of admission and were continued; upon
discharge, plan was for a steroid taper.  As above, both PT and
OT were consulted.

3. DVT:
Patient had recent history of DVT, diagnosed [**2172-4-14**].  Presented
on daily lovenox, which was held before surgery.
Post-operatively, the lovenox was held for two days and resumed
on discharge.

4. Lung cancer:
Was status-post lobectomry.  This issue was stable during
admission.
