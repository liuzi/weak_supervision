61 year old female with COPD on 3L home O2 s/p recent admission
[**12-2**] for COPD exacerbation and newly diganosed LUL mass now
admitted with respiratory distress.
.
#. Acute hypercarbic respiratory distress/Cough: On admission,
the patient was complaining of 3 days of cough and SOB that
acutely worsened overnight. She presented to an OSH and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further managment.  She was
placed on BiPAP in the ED and transferred to the MICU. She had
hypercapneia with a PCO2 of 57 initially, and was placed on non
rebreather mask with little improvement, and was then started on
non invasive positive pressure ventilation. Patient however
tolerated this poorly and required intubation for severe
respiratory distress.
During acute decompensation, It was noted that patient was
taking very high frequency shallow breaths with a constant cough
like sound generated in the upper airway. Patient was relatively
easy to ventilate and this raised question of paradoxycal vocal
cord dysfunction, phrenic nerve injury, etc. During intubation
however, vocal cords were noted to be normal in appearance and
during serial imaging diaphragms remained symmetrical.
Patient was treated with pulse dose steroids and started on
Azithromicyn. Given known left upper lobe nodule, a CT scan of
the chest was performed and did not show any significant
interval change. Patient was sucessfully extubated on [**1-28**] with
short NIVPPV bridge. Patient was transfered to medical floor on
[**1-28**].  She had an uneventful course and was discharged in stable
condition.
Pt has been having financial problems and has not been able to
afford Tiotropium (Spiriva).  Social work was consulted and she
was given Ipratropium instead.
Patient was slowly weaned off steroids with taper over the next
2-3 weeks.

#. Fibromyalgia: Difficult to control, with overt anxiety in
spite of [**Hospital 17073**] medical regimen. We continued regimen with
fentanyl patch, gabapentin, SOMA, darvocet, amitryptline and
Propoxyphene

#. Anxiety: Patient with many social stressors and difficult to
control anxiety. Given progression of symptoms inspite of
agressive therapy, she was to follow up her outpatient
psychiatrist to address her anxiety.

# Anemia: During admission noted to be near baseline of 31.
There was no overt bleeding or hemolysis.
