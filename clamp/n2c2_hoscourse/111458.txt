79F with locally advanced pancreatic CA on Xeloda and
oxaliplatin (C2D1 [**2166-1-8**]) admitted with diarrhea.

# Diarrhea:
Most likely [**1-25**] chemotherapy, though infectious cause possible.
Cdiff was negative.  She was given IV Fluids, prn antiemetics,
and her electrolytes were corrected prn.  After cdiff was
negative x 1, she was given symptomatic treatment of her
diarrhea with loperamide.  She continued to have nausea and
profuse diarrhea, and she was given tincture of opium as well as
octreotide.

# Sepsis:
After several days in the hospital, she became acutely
hypotensive, tachycardic and hypoxic.  She was emergently
transferred to the ICU, where NG tube was placed with immediate
output of almost a liter of feculent material.  She was put on
broad spectrum antibiotics and central line was placed for
aggressive fluid repletion.  Blood pressure was supported with
levophed.  She was intubated for airway protection given concern
for aspiration pneumonia.  Cause of patient's acute
decompensation was unclear.  The team considered infection from
bowel source (microperforation, SBP), aspiration event, or
possible PE.  CTA was not done given patient's worsening renal
function and unstable clinical status.

Surgery was consulted and did not feel that the patient was a
candidate for surgical intervention.

Patient remained intubated and on pressors for several days.
Antibiotics were selected to cover possible bowel pathogens
given concern that she could have had microperforations or
perhaps SBP given new finding of ascites on imaging.  Despite
aggressive care, the patient continued to deteriorate.  Her
daughters (and health care proxy) agreed that the patient would
not wish to continue aggressive care given her poor prognosis.
The decision was made with the attending to make the patient
comfort measures only; she was extubated and died later that
day.

Patient's daughters agreed that they would want an autopsy to
help understand what had caused their mother to deteriorate.

# Acute renal failure - Oliguric on arrival to ICU. Cr quickly
improved with IV fluids and support of MAPs.

# Pancreatic CA - Metastatic to lungs, although with fairly good
functional status prior to admission.  Onc fellow contact[**Name (NI) **] upon
ICU transfer.  Chemotherapy was held and patient's family agreed
upon comfort care after discussing the matter with her
oncologists, the ICU team, and palliative care.

# Coagulopathy:
Patient's INR increased during admission despite holding
coumadin.  DIC labs were negative.  Patient's INR improved with
FFP and vitamin K.

#. UTI:
There is a postive UA and bandemia. She was afebrile and had no
urinary symptoms.  UCx showed mixed flora.  She was given a
three day course of cipro.
