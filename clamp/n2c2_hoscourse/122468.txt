  A head CT was performed in the Emergency
Department demonstrating no acute intracranial hemorrhage as
the patient was felt likely to have had a stroke.  An MR was
performed.  In fact, she had an acute right frontal lobe
infarct extending to the splenule of the corpus callosum.  In
addition, she had diffuse atherosclerotic changes without
focal high-grade stenosis in the posterior circulation,
vascular occlusion, or stenosis in the anterior circulation.

The patient was continued on aspirin and started on Plavix.
Her blood pressure was maintained by holding her
antihypertensives.  Neurology was consulted.  The patient was
not a candidate for TPA given chronicity of her symptoms.

The patient was prepared for carotid artery stenting by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] which was attempted on [**2176-7-11**].  However, a stent
was not placed due to the patient moving on the table.  The
patient will return in two weeks to have the procedure
performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
