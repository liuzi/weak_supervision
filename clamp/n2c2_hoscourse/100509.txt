[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course [**Date range (3) 84902**]
58F with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC
syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial
effusion, resolved pleural effusion and pneumothorax, and
electrolytes disturbances admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for radiation
decompression therapy and chemotherapy. Pt developed respiratory
failure and renal failure.
.
#. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt was initially transferred
from SICU to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on CPAP/PS. She developed increasing
respiratory failure and was changed to AC mode.  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
she underwent XRT x2 and then chemotherapy for 3 days. Increased
hypoxia may have been due to pneumothorax, which resolved,
pleural effusions, atelectasis, possible VAP, tumor compression.
During hypoxic episodes, pt underwent bronchoscopy twice, both
times of which demonstrated the ETT lodged between tracheal wall
and stent. Pt's saturation improved with repositioning.
Respiratory status also complicated by possible underlying COPD
given smoking history with possible air stacking/trapping. Pt
was started on vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin (started
[**2172-8-31**] for 8 day course) for VAP. Vanco was later held as the
level was elevated in the setting of renal failure.  Patient's
family decided to persue comfort only care on [**2172-9-6**], and she
was terminally extubated.  Patient expired 15 minutes later from
respiratory failure and asystole secondary to lung cancer.
.
# Altered Mental Status: Pt had decline in mental status over
time. She initially withdrew from noxious stimuli but later was
less responsive. AMS continued despite sedation being off. AMS
most likely due to toxic metabolic syndrome in setting of uremia
and multi-system organ failure. Differential also included
seizure (given hx of cerebral aneurysm repair, on
anti-epileptics presumably prophylactically) although EEG did
not demonstrate focal abnormalities. LP did not demonstrate
infection or spread of malignancy. CT head [**2172-9-2**] negative for
acute process.
.
#. Small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor probably
fits into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. Given
associated SVC syndrome, prognosis poor. CT head/[**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis
negative for metastases.  Pt underwent 3 days of chemotherapy
and 2 sessions of XRT.  Initially, XRT was clinical emergency -
normal and pathologic tissue was likely treated; necrotic tissue
noted on bronchoscopy [**2172-9-4**]. Pt was to undergo formal tissue
planning session on [**2172-9-8**] to better delineate area of radiation
however family decided to persue comfort only care on [**2172-9-6**].
.
# Acute Renal failure: In setting of chemo with carboplatin.
Urine casts consistent with ATN. Uric acid and electrolytes
elevated 4-5d post chemotherapy concerning for tumor lysis
syndrome.  The next therapeutic step was dialysis as patient
became oliguric despite volume overload but the family wished
for comfort only care given dismal prognosis of her lung cancer.
.
#. Metabolic acidosis: Originally thought to be non-gap
metabolic acidosis due to hypoaldosteronism and type IV RTA.
With low albumin, however, this is a gap metabolic acidosis,
most likely due to uremia. Unable to increase RR to compensate
due to concern for auto-peeping in setting of possible COPD.
Goal pH is 7.3-7.35. On [**2172-9-5**], pt's acidosis worsened with pH
7.16-7.18. Despite adjusting ETT placement and decreasing RR to
reduce auto-peep, pt's acidosis worsened. Bicarbonate was given.

.
# Tachycardia/Hypotension ?????? Pt with tachycardia to 140s and
episodes of hypotension to SBP low 80s. Pt with new A-fib on
telemetry and EKG. DDx includes possible enlarging pericardial
effusion/tamponade but pulsus paradoxus was normal and ECHO
[**2172-9-5**] was unchanged from prior. No pneumothorax seen on CXR.
Unable to assess for PE by CTA as pt in renal failure and VQ
would not be helpful in setting of other lung pathology. LENI's
negative for DVT. PE likely given malignancy and prolonged bed
rest but unable to do CTA given renal failure and VQ scan not
helpful in setting of lung changes. Even if it had been
positive, heme/onc recommended against anti-coagulation in
setting of possible tumor necrosis/hemorrhage. Pt remained
tachycardic to 130s despite numerous fluid boluses.
.
#. Electrolyte disturbances: Pt developed hypernatremia on
[**2172-9-4**] most likley due to dehydration with free water deficit
of 1.4L, started on D5W. Pt had hyponatremia and hyperkalemia on
admission, both resolved. Unclear etiology of electrolyte
disturbances on admission- hyponatremia thought to be secondary
to possible adrenal insufficency (now discarded) or possibly
SIADH.  Low UNa does not exclude SIADH; renal recommended
rechecking urine lytes with saline load, whcih was not done in
setting of pt??????s other medical issues. Hyperkalemia originally
attributed to hypoaldosteronism and Type IV RTA, but unlikely
per endocrine because of low urine sodium.
.
#. SVC syndrome:  Incomplete occlusion of SVC; near complete
occlusion of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by
upper extremity and facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin.
Also with scleral edema. Unable to assess jugular venous
distension given considerable swelling. Seen in appoximately 10%
cases of SSLC. Improved edema on exam compared to admission. SVC
syndrome occurred after Y-stent placed. Possible that tumor
pushing into trachea shifted to compress SVC after stent
placement. She underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy for
decompression.
.
#. Pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement
[**2172-8-25**], removed [**2172-8-31**]. LDH effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate by
Light??????s criteria). Greatest concern for malignant effusion
however cytology was nonspecific.  Cultures of fluid all
preliminary negative.
.
#. Pneumothorax: Developed pneumothorax in setting of
re-intubation that resolved after chest tube placement.
.
#. Pericardial effusion:  Suspected by cardiology to be
malignant effusion. Felt not to be large enough for percutaneous
drainage. EKG without signs of electrical alternans but does
have low voltages. Repeat ECHO done [**2172-9-5**] in setting of
hypotension demonstrated no change in pericardial effusion.
.
# Sinus Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of sinus pauses on
tele night of [**8-30**] with turning to right side. Occurred again
[**2172-9-4**] again with re-positioning. Metoprolol was held and
glucagon given in case this was due to beta blocker toxicity,
but pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their own
without intervention. Cardiology consulted who felt it was
vagally mediated. [**Month (only) 116**] have been due to ETT tube displacement
pressing on carotid when pt was turned.
.
# Leukopenia/thrombocytopenia ?????? Most likely due to chemotherapy
and no improvement in counts on neupogen. She was repeatedly
pan-cultured with negative results.
.
#. Anemia:  Normocytic and likely due to anemia of chronic
disease given malignancy.  Hemolysis labs were negative.
.
# s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  History of cerebral aneurysm
repair with a number of chronic changes on head CT.  Her
antiepileptic medications were continued.
