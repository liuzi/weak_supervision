#Pericardial Effusion:  A CXR done on admission noted a left
pleural effusion.  A bedside thoracentesis was to be performed,
however on ultrasound the heart was noted to be close to the
wall. A chest CT was done [**9-22**] which was remarkable for a small
to moderate left effusion with a significant pericardial
effusion and ascending thoracic aorta aneurysm.  An echo was
performed [**9-22**] at the bedside due to concern for tamponade which
showed probable moderate/severe aortic regurgitation with a a
sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp, moderate
sized pericardial effusion without evidence of frank tamponade,
although the right atrium does not fully dilate during atrial
diastole, suggesting either low filling pressures or early
tamponade. A formal echo was performed on [**9-23**] dialted aortic
root with probable small sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right
coronary cusp and severe aortic regurgitaton, a moderate
circumferential pericardial effusion without frank tamponade.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended CT with contrast due to
concern for dissection; CT showed dissection of the thoracic
ascending aorta with possible rupture into pericardium.  CT
surgery was consulted who recomended surgery but the patient
declined. She was medically managed with HR and blood pressure
control but continued to decline over the next several days with
increasing oxygen requirements eventually requiring 100% on a
non-rebreather. The patient and her family made the decision to
be made comfort measures only on [**9-27**]. She was given morphine
and she passed away with her family at her side on the morning
of [**2100-9-28**].

# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient has history of atrial
fibrillation on coumadin diagnosed post operatively for a hip
fracture in [**2099-2-7**].  Coumadin was held in setting of GI
bleed.  She was given 5 mg IV metoprolol x2 and rates slowed to
the 120's.  She then had a likely vagal episode and became
acutely bradycardic with a 6 second pause.  The episode resolved
spontaneously and the patient reverted back to atrial
fibrillation.  The patient was transitioned to 25 mg metoprolol
TID but remained in a-fib with rvr. She was placed intermitantly
on diltizem drip and converted to NSR with rates in the 60s.
When the decision was made to make her CMO, these were
discontinued.

#Bright red blood per rectum: The patient present with bright
red blood per rectum in the setting of an elevated INR of 8.0
and HCT of 29.0.  Her hematocrit dropped to 24.2.  She received
2 units pRBCs and had an appropriate rise in hematocrit.  The
INR was corrected with 2 units FFP and 5 mg vitamin K x 2.
Gastroenterology was consulted  who felt this was likely a lower
GI bleed, most likely diverticular or AVM, exacerbated in the
setting of elevated INR. Also on the differential diagnosis are
hemorrhoids and malignancy.  She did have a colonoscopy in [**2098**]
that did not show any polyps, making malignancy unlikely.  The
patient's hematocrit stabled and she had no further episodes of
bleeding.

# Hypoxia: Patient with intermittent desaturation.  Etiology
likely multifactorial secondary to pericardial effusion and poor
reserve with underlying myasthenia.  The CXR did not show any
evidence of acute infection.  She was placed on nasal cannula to
maintain oxygen saturation >92%.  Please see above, but the
patient had increasing oxygen requirments eventually requiring
100% on a non-rebreather. At that time the patient made the
decision to be made CMO.

# Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: The patient was recently diagnosed with
myasthenia after 3 years of progressive symptoms.  She had a
positive anti-acetylchoine receptor antibody and was started on
pyridostigmine with little improvement. She was recently starte
on mestinon.  Neurology was consulted regarding diagnosis and
treatment and concern for underlying malignancy with
paraneoplastic syndrome.  They recommended monitoring vital
capacity and negative inspiratory force.  Neurology weighed in
regarding possibe surgery and advised that the patient may have
a slower recovery coming off of the vent.  The patient and her
family made the decision to be made comfort measures only on
[**9-27**]. She was given morphine and she passed away with her family
at her side on the morning of [**2100-9-28**].
