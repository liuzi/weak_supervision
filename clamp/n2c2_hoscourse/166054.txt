#Hypotension: Original ddx was early sepsis vs. narcotics
related vs. cardiogenic vs adrenal insufficiency. He required
levophed and aggressive fluid hydration to maintain SBP>100 and
was started on fludrocotisone for possible adrenal
insufficiency. Pt had flat JVP and warm extremities, no evidence
of tamponade. He was ruled out for MI by enzymes, and cardiology
consult did not not think picture was c/w cardiogenic shock. A
cortasyn stim test was performed and he was seen to respond, so
we discontinued fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone. Sepsis was
considered and he was broadly covered on admission with
ambisome, imipenem, voriconazole. He was weaned off vasopressors
and IVF on HD3 and SBP's remained in the 90's but he was
asymptomatic, making urine, and had normal lactate so no further
intervention was made.
.
#ID:
a) Pulmonary nodules:
Pt had history of pulmonary nodules thought to be of fungal
origin without positive cultures data. He had been on empiric
treatment for fungal process with ambisome and vorinazole for 3
months, then voriconazole alone since [**4-1**], but was off this for
four days before admission. Chest CT revealed no nodular
infection but a RLL infiltrate concerning for CAP and on HD2 was
started on levofloxacin. At that same time he was started on
Vancomycin since his allergy was questionable and he had a
permanent tunneled line. He developed periorbital edema and
diffuse skin etyhema, elevated LFT's and eosinophilia thought
initially due to vancomycin so this was stopped. Vancomycin was
changed to daptomycin which was stopped [**4-21**] given blood cultures
remained negative x 48 hours. Infectious workup in looking for
source of sepsis included urine, blood and sputum culture,
fungal , AFB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 14616**], mycoplasma, [**Name10 (NameIs) 14616**] urine Ag,
galatomannan all of which were negative. Pt's LFT's continued to
rise off of the vancomycin so the levofloxacin was changed to
azithromycin which he completed a 10 day course of. He was then
started on voriconazole as below for risk of recurrence of
fungal infection with immunosuppressive treatment for GVHD as
below.

Elevated LFT's-Pt continued to have climbing LFT with a
cholestatic picture initially thought to be due to drug reaction
by both ID and dermatology. Skin biopsy showed complete
separation of dermis and epidermis consistent with drug rash.
Alkaline phosphatase continued to rise despite rash improving so
then arose concern for GVHD as had occured in the past. At this
point he was started on cyclosporine dosed to trough >100 and a
day later Mycofenolate was added. Liver team was consulted and
felt this was most likely GVHD and got a liver biopsy. Biopsy
revealed diffuse biliary destruction consistent with GVHD
although it was unclear if this was old or new. He was continued
on immunosuppressive therapy as above and on [**5-3**] was feeling
well so plan was made for further workup and treatment of
elevated LFT's as an outpt.
.
#Chest/Neck pain: T wave changes on EKG were non-diagnostic. It
didn't appear to be due to ischemia given he was ruled out for
MI with serial enzymes and had no events on telemetry. CTA
showed no PE/aortic dissection. Most likely cause of pain is
pleuritic chest pain from pneumonia. He was treated with his
outpatient dose of oxycontin in hospital which he responded well
to.
.
#Anemia: baseline hct was around 28 thought to be anemia of
chronic diseae.
Hemolysis labs were negative
