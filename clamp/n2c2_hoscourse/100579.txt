67 year old man 1 month s/p AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3, now with
fever to 100.9, WBC 18.7 admitted with possible pneumonia and
cellulitis, rule out mediastinitis.

# Fever/Pseudomonal pneumonia: Pt had CT chest that indicated
some stranding around sternum, but thoracic surgery did not
think CT was consistent with mediastinitis, but that changes
were characteristic of post-op changes. No evidence of
cellulitis on exam, and although PICC line appeared normal, it
was removed for concern for line infection. Pt found to have new
ventilator-associated pneumonia, and had bronchoscopy that
showed copious secretions. Sputum grew multi-drug resistant
pseudomonas. During the admission the pt was thought to have had
a ceftriaxone allergic reaction (morbilloform drug rash) and
ceftriaxone was added to allergy list. Pt was discharged to
rehab on tobramycin with plan to complete a 14 day course, that
will be complete on [**2125-11-4**]. He will need his tobra level
checked every 3 days to see if his dose needs adjustment. Renal
function should be checked q3 days while on the tobra to ensure
proper dosing.

Continued amiodarone, coumadin, statin, aspirin and restarted
