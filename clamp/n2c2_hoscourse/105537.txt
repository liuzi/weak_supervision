Hospital Course:
.
# Fever/Pancytopenia/ID/Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis: Pt
had been afebrile since [**11-4**] and all ABX d/c'ed on [**11-6**],
however, Vanco/Ceftaz were restarted on [**11-7**] for Tm of 102.2.
Concern was for VAP given increased respiratory secretions vs
recurrent pancreatitis with pseudocyst as pancreas enzymes were
rising after recently having restarted TF.  CT Abd/pelvis was
without evidence of worsening radiographic pancreatitis.  Other
sources considered included line infections (Right IJ recently
replaced in same site) or C. diff given prolonged ABX course.
.
Extensive prior infectious workup had revealed a positive EBV
IgM, EBV PCR, and EBV PCR in CSF.  Given pancyotpenia,
splenomegaly, and EBV infection Heme/Onc and ID were considered
the diagnosis of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis, which was
confirmed by repeat bone marrow biopsy (first biopsy
unremarkable).  Pt was begun on etoposode, IVIG and decadron on
~[**11-7**].  His pancytopenia was also treated with epogen and
neupogen.
.
Per HEME, HLH likely triggered by underlying EBV infection.
While there was evidence of EBV in the CSF; because of normal
Protein no need for IT-MTX.  The patient was started on a
steroid taper (currently on 10 mg Decadron) and will need 8
weeks total of Etoposide.  Renal failure, pancreatic
abnormalities, and elevated LFTs all thought to be d/t
underlying HLH.  In addition, ID consults did not recommend
treating EBV viremia with anti-virals.
.
On [**11-9**], pt was noted to have EBSL klebsiella in a sputum and
BAL sample, and was begun on meropenem for 14 day course. He
continued to develop low grade temperature (100.0-100.6), which
were attributed to his HLH, IVIG, and CVVHD.
.
#  Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated on [**2118-10-30**] for impending
respiratory distress at time of his ERCP.  Upon admission to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**11-7**], his respiratory mechanics had improved
considerably, and he was oxygenating and ventilating well on PS
5/0.  Initially unable to extubate secondary to altered mental
status and increased secretions.  Pt was often desyncrhonous on
vent secondary to hiccups when sedation weaned.  As mental
status improved gradually, pt was extubated on [**11-10**].   His
respiratory status continued to improve slowly, despite +BAL for
EBSL klebsiella and total body fluid overload, and on [**11-14**] pt
was sat'ing >95% on RA.
.
# Mental Status - pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] alert & oriented,
however his mental status subsequently declined.  After
intubation on [**10-30**], pt remained largely sedated until just
prior to admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**11-7**].  Attempts to wean
sedation were limited by hiccups which resulted in dysynchrony
the mechanical ventilation, breif neuro exam at time of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
admission with sedation weaned revealed pt responsive only to
deep painful stimulus (sternal rub),  pupils minimally reactive
to light bilaterally, gag was present, with slow corneal reflex.
 +hyperreflexia, though tone was flacid, and 5-10 beat clonus of
both feet was noted which initially worsened to 20 beat clonus
on [**11-11**] before slowly improving.
.
Was seen by the neurology/psychiatry services given his new
neurological findings and h/o myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] (which
predominantly was ocular per pt's family).  EEG was obtained
which showed diffuse slowing, but no focus of seizure activity.
CT head on [**11-7**] unremarkable. Over the course of his first week
in the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt's mental status improved dramatically,
presumably with chemotherapy.  By [**11-14**] pt was alert, pleasantly
conversive, and following all commands.  His imuran for
myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] has been held since admission.  Neuro also
noted proximal weakness of his arms, which improved during his
hospital course.  Per Neruo, he should hold Imuran until he
follows up with Neuro as an outpatient.
.
# Renal - pt without h/o CRI, developed ARF likely secondary to
ATN from hypotension and underlying HLH on [**11-1**].  Pt was
started on CVVHD at that time for volume overload [**2-17**] anuria,
however, UOP gradually improved, and on [**11-15**] pt was
discontinued from HD.  Creatinine normal on discharge.
.
# Cholestasis/hepatitis/pancreatitis - pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
from OSH with RUQ pain, fever, and elevated LFTs (Tbil 7's), for
which he underwent ERCP with CBD stent on [**11-2**].  LFTs have
since trended down, though amylase/lipase (peak in 1000s) were
starting to plateau at 500s on [**11-14**].  CT abdomen showed
pancreatic fluid collection, but not psuedocyst or necrosis.  On
[**11-13**] pt denied abdominal pain, and was hungry, thus was
transitioned from TPN to TF cautiously, as prior attempt to
restart tube feeds was limited by bump in amylase/lipase.  On
[**11-14**], pt was tolerating TF without difficulty, in addition to
sips of clear liquids, thus he was advanced to a regular diet
after a speech & consult was obtained. On the floor, he
tolerated his diet without other clinical s/sx of pancreatitis.
.
Psych:  thought the patient had a mild encephalopathy that was
slowly resolving.  Recommeded Haldol/Seroquel for sleep;
however, this made the patient feel strage.  Given resolution of
MS changes, ok for patient to receive ambien at rehab prn.
.
HTN: kept on Lopressor 100 mg TID with excellent results.
