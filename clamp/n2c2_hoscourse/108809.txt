On [**10-6**] the pt presented to an OSH with abdominal pain where a
CT abdomen was done which showed an aortic dissection. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and had a confirmatory CTA.  She was
admitted to the ICU for blood pressure control and serial
abdominal exams.

At the time of presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] she was not complaining of
any abdominal pain and her vascular exam was unchanged (palpable
bilateral upper and lower extremity pulses).  She was agitated
while in the ICU and received Ativan to which she became
delerious.  She was seen by psychiatry for acute delerium and
they asked to hold ativan and to use Hadol for any agitation.

She remained stable and the plan was to manage her medially.
She was transferred to the VICU.  On the morning of [**2112-10-10**] she
was complaining of upper abdominal pain and retro sternal pain.
Her VS were stable at that pt as was her EKG.  On exam she
looked slightly pale without diaphoresis.  Her distal pulses
were all palpable at that time. She was sent for stat CTA and
then sent to prep and hold where she was consented for TEVAR.
It was noted on the CT that she had extension of her dissection
with possible compressive thrombus.

She underwent the procedure without complication. She was
recovered in the VICU and did well.  Her diet and activity were
advanced. She was voiding freely and tolerating an oral diet.
She ambulated without assistance.  Her follow up appts were
scheduled.  She was councelled to follow up with her PCP within
two weeks.
