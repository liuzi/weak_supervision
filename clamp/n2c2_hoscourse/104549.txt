Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year-old man with a PMH notable for ESRD on HD
(MWF), chronic aspiration, seizure disorder, history of CVA with
residual left-sided weakness and dysarthria, who presented to
the ED s/p seizure and hypoglycemia. Course was complicated by
RP bleed, s/p IR embolization of R renal artery [**2112-11-17**], PNA
s/p course of Vanc/Zosyn/Tobra, and inability to clear his own
secretions with subsequent recurrent mucus plugging and chronic
aspiration, leading to episodes of hypoxic respiratory distress.
.
# Seizures: The patient had a witnessed event in which he had
whole-body shaking and was non-responsive. DDx for seizure
precipitant includes metabolic etiology such as [**2-24**] hypoglycemia
vs. infection vs. medication non-compliance. Not likely acute
intracranial process as no changed on CT head w/o. No reason to
believe that the patient has been missing his medications, per
family and daycare. He has no complaints, and no s/s of
infection (no fever, symptoms, and CXR w/no focal infiltrate),
which could also precipitate seizures. Per reviewing [**Name (NI) **], pt has
been admitted frequently for these seizures every few months.
The ED [**Name (NI) 653**] pt's outpt Neurologist who recommended
increasing Keppra dose to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] and continuing 500mg after
HD and checking a level.  Keppra level was obtained but pending
as it is a send out. Oxcarbazepine 150mg [**Hospital1 **] continued.
Treatment of hypoglycemia as below.
.
# Hypoglycemia: Pt presented with significant hypoglycemia of
unknown etiology. There is no evidence of iatrogenic cause of
hypoglycemia.  Workup included fasting C-peptide and insulin
level, which were non-diagnostic given the venous glucose for
the specimen was not less than 50.  There was no evidence of
adrenal insufficiency.  His hypoglycemia resolved after RP bleed
for unclear reasons.
.
# Aspiration: Pt has a documented history of chronic aspiration
likely secondary to his CVA, and has been evaluated by speech
and swallow multiple times in the past.  Pt was found to be at
increased risk for aspiration.  However, family in the past had
insisted on continued feeding, regardless of aspiration risk.
In [**Month (only) **], speech and swallow commented that "As aspiration
risks are similar across consistencies, pt comfort should be
deciding factor in diet order".  Pt was placed on mechanical
soft diet/dysphagia diet on admission, as quality of life was
considered to be the number one priority by the family.  During
this admission, pt was found to have significant worsening
aspiration, manifested by copious secretions in airway.  He had
multiple episodes of desatting both in the MICU and on the
regular floor.  He collapsed his right lung several times in the
setting of mucus plugging.  For all these episodes, he responded
well with suction and chest PT.  After lengthy discussion with
family, decision was made to feed the patient despite the
aspiration risk. A PEG tube was deferred given successful eating
without obvious aspiration.
.
# Fistula thrombosis/Access: Following his stay in the ICU the
patient had a thrombosed fistula.  The level of thrombosis was
too much for vascular or for IR to open the fistula.  He had a
temporary line placed that was converted to a tunneled catheter
for dialysis and IR was able to place a PICC for further access
via venogram.  He will be discharged on a heparin
drip-to-warfarin bridge for this thrombosis and a
catheter-associated thrombus in the right IJ.
.
# Line infection: The patient had pus noted around his right IJ
following his time in the ICU.  Cultures subsequently grew
resistant Klebsiella and coagulase negative gram positive cocci,
along with confirmation from 1 subsequent blood culture.  He
will be treated for a total of two weeks with vancomycin and
cefepime, to be completed on [**2112-12-20**].

# Retroperitoneal bleed with subsequent anemia: Pt was found to
have tachycardia and hypotension on HD#7, with a 9-point HCT
drop.  He underwent CTA, and was found to have multifocal
retroperitoneal bleed in the right kidney.  He was admitted to
MICU and intubated for airway protection.  Pt had a total of 9
units pRBC.  Transcatheter embolization of the right kidney was
performed and hemodynamic stability was achieved.  Subsequently,
his hematocrit continued to run low, requiring intermittent
transfusions of RBCs at dialysis, with a nadir of 19.9.
Nephrology will be assessing whether he should be started on
Epogen at dialysis.
.
# Pneumonia: Pt was found to have pneumonia on MICU day 4, with
leukocytosis and
fever.  The etiology of pneumonia was HCAP vs VAP.  He was
treated with vanco, zosyn and tobra for a total of 9 days.  His
WBC and fever resolved s/p antibiotics treatment.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# ESRD on HD: MWF, received dialysis on schedule.  Access is now
a tunneled line, given AVG thrombosis and he should be continued
on sevelamer and nephrocaps.
.
# Pancytopenia: Pt with macroycytic anemia and thrombocytopenia
prior. However, WBC mildly decreased at presentation to 3.0,
which is a change from prior. No s/s infection, CXR without
focal infiltrate as above.  B12 and folate were high.
.
# CAD/CVA history: ECG unchanged from prior. We initially
continued home aspirin, statin, metoprolol, and coumadin, but
the RP bleed complicated this regimen.  Once embolization was
done and hematocrit was deemed stable, multiple thromboses were
discovered in right IJ and RUE AVG.  Therefore, a heparin drip
was started and he was bridged to coumadin.
.
# Depression: on fluoxetine as listed discharge med but held on
discharge as it causes hypoglycemia and it can lower the seizure
threshold.
