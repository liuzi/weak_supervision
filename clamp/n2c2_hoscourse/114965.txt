26M who was admitted to Neurosurgery for a right frontal cystic
lesion and a sellar/suprasellar mass with subsequent
hydrocephalus. He admitted to the ICU for close observation
given his imaging. A MRI was obtained on [**5-10**] to better evaluate
the lesions.

On [**5-11**] a CTA head was obtained for surgical planning. Endocrine
was also consulted given the sellar/suprasellar mass. Per
Endocrine request, labs were ordered and a cortisol stimulation
test was done on [**5-12**] AM. Hydrocortisone was held in order to
perform cortisol stim test.a 1 gram Dilantin bolus was given for
a serum dilantin level of 0.8. Overnight the patient became very
aggitated, pulling out his IV line requiring ativan.  The
patient got out of bed and wanted to leave the hospital "Against
Medical Advice"

On [**5-12**], patient was seen to have bitemporal hemianopsia, but
was otherwise intact on examination. The Cortisol Stim teast was
performed and the cortisol levels at 30 minites, 60 minites and
90 minites were.2-30 mins,21-60 mins,22- 90 mins.  Neuro-optho
was consulted for formal visual field testing which was done on
[**2149-5-13**] which demonstrated stable bitemporal hemianopsia.
Endocrine recommended stopping the hydrocortisone and decreasing
the decadron. Neuro and rad oncology were also consulted.

On [**2149-5-14**], Patient underwent am aspiration of the right frontal
cyst and EVD placement.  He tolerated the procedure well without
intraoperative complications.  Please review dictated operative
report for details. He was extubated and transferred to the ICU.
Post operative Head CT revealed no hemorrhage and significant
decompression.  He was bolused with 500mg of Dilantin for a
subtherapeuric level of 7.2 and his dose was increased to 200mg
[**Hospital1 **].

On [**5-15**] the EVD was clamped after CT head demonstrated stable
ventricular size however it had to be opened approximately
2.5hrs after clamping for severe headache and episode of
confusion.  It was opened at 10cm above the tragus.  Per
Endocrinology the patient was given cabergoline 0.5mg as a
one-time dose and the patient was switched from dexamethasone to
prednisone 7.5mg daily according to their recommendations.  He
was given a Dilantin bolus of 500mg for a Dilantin level of 9.6.


On [**5-16**] the patient's mental status was stable and so an EVD
wean was started.  The patient tolerated elevation of the drain
to 20cm above the tragus.  Dilantin level was therapeutic at
12.9.  Pt was transfered to the stepdown unit.  His ventricular
drain was clamped several times but patient continued to have
elevated ICPs and severe headaches.  Plan for VP shunt was
postponed on [**5-20**] for fever to 102.7.  Fever workup was negative
for DVT with lower extremity Dopplers, negative consolidation on
chest xray.  Blood, urine and CSF cultures were sent on [**5-20**].
He devoloped a total body rash that resembled a reaction to
dilantin and so the patient was transitioned to Keppra, Dilantin
was stopped and the rash was treated topically with
hydrocortisone cream and with Oral benadryl PRN.  No respiratory
distress, no oral swelling. He was afebrile on [**5-21**] and was
neurolopgically stable with EVD in place while awaiting VP shunt
placement.

On [**2149-5-23**], patient had a right VP shunt place by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. On
the day of surgery he had stress dose steroids with
Hydrocortisone 50mg Q8 and then resumed prednisone 7.5mg daily.

Now DOD, pt is afebrile, vital signs are stable, and tolerating
a good oral diet.  His pain is well controlled and incision
appear clean/dry/intact.  He is set for d/c home in stable
condition.
