61 y/o F admitted for Autologous Bone marrow transplant with CBV
regimen for treatment of large B-cell lymphoma. She is status
post multiple chemotherapy regimens and a BM harvest in the OR
after failed peripheral blood stem cell collection
.
Lymphoma: The patient was admitted to undergo autologous stem
cell transplantation with high dose chemotherapy with CBV
therapy. Admitted Day-7 and began chemotherapy D-7. Etoposide,
Cytoxan, MESNA, BCNU given with last dose 9/30. Day -2 started
acyclovir, ursodiol.  PBCS given during course of chemo. [**10-17**]-
Day -1 patient complained of severe nausea with emesis. [**10-18**], on
day 0 stem cells given with gross hematuria during. Hematuria
prior considered hemorrhagic cystitis related to cytoxan.
Patient vigorously hydrated. Course complicated by severe
nausea, emesis, severe mucositis, and prolonged neutropenia.
Mucositis severe with difficulty swallowing secretions,
hematocrit and platelets monitored and patient made NPO with TPN
and fentanyl PCA for pain. Mucositis greatly improved by [**10-31**],
but unfortunately patient did not engraft as of day +17, ANC
150, with very slow progression of WBC, though given bone marrow
would expect slower recovery.
.
Fever: Pt developed a fever to 100.9 on [**10-12**]. Cultures sent,
Chest x-ray with likely pneumonia. Penicillin allergy, pt unsure
if cephalasporin as well. Treated with levofloxacin and
vancomycin. Continued with chemo. Concerning given for
autologous SCT 3 days of chemo with new pneumonia, though
patient asymptomatic and not dramatic picture on CXR. With
persistence of low grade temps cefepime also started [**10-15**].
Patient completed seven day course for CAP on [**10-15**]. line site
with erythema, pt still febrile, added flagyl to already broad
coverage of cefepime, vanc, caspo.
cefepime started [**10-19**], DC [**10-25**]. flagyl started [**10-24**], DC [**10-25**].
meropenem started [**10-25**], given nausea. caspo started [**10-21**]. [**10-26**]
pulled subclavian line on right. Pt febrile despite being on
meropenem, vancomycin, caspofungin, acyclovir, with no blood
cultures or catheter tip cultures positive to date. Of note
patient neutropenic with ANC 150 day +17.
.
Dysphagia- onset [**10-18**] in relation to severe mucositis,
etiologies to consider primarily musositis, though viral
bacterial, fungal infection, [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear from severe
wretching all possibilities. Patient kept NPO, TPN started,
acyclovir, cefepime, and fentanyl PCA. Improved by day +15, and
patient able to tolerate PO, though with emesis.
.
Anemia, thrombocytopenia- epistaxis. Platelets and PRBC
transfusions throughout course of stay.
.
nausea- zofran, ativan, and anzemet with chemo. scopolamine
patch attempted in addition to decadron 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Patient
continued to have severe nausea which dissipated one into
treatment but returned three weeks into treatment once patient
attempted to restart PO intake. Emesis shortly after eating with
no associated cramping. Patient with bowel movements and passing
flatus. KUB negative for obtruction and patient encouraged to
start slow with PO to advance as tolerated.
.
ICU COURSE:
Patient transferred to ICU on [**2157-11-27**] after found to have a
worsening RML consolidation, occluded RML bronchus, and
bilateral effusions. Pt underwent bronchoscopy, had new O2
requirement (94% on 6L) after the procedure. She was
subsequently placed on BiPAP, progressively worsening SOB and O2
requirement, and became more SOB requiring 60% FM with 6L NC to
maintain O2 sat in the 90's. Pt transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
closer monitoring. She had repeat bronchoscopy. Large mucous
plug noted in RML bronchus, unable to be removed.
.
Ultimately, her SOB/hypoxia felt possibly an infectious etiology
although no identified source after 3 BALs. Pt with significant
lung pathology (RML consolidation, RML bronchus occlusion, and
BL pleural effusions) as well as RLL involvment. She had three
total bronchs without bug isolated. Abx regimen: levoflox,
flagyl, caspo, Posaconazle later switched to ambisome, and
Minocylcine. Minocycline for coverage of some Nocardia species
(other options cause marrow suppression including Bactrim,
Linezolid). Meropenem was attempted; however, after
desensitization, patient developed A-fib after dose. It was
unclear and unlikely that the afib was related to the meropenam.

.
During her ICU course, she also developed Afib with RVR. Started
on Procainamide, per cards recs. She continued metoprolol 25mg
PO BID, discontinued digoxin. Her hemondynamic status was
unstable and metoprolol was then stopped. Then, she was noted to
have several episodes of V tach, which resolved prior to
requiring pads. Her QTc was monitored while on Procainamide.
.
On [**2157-11-30**], her cardiac status had not improved. She also
became hypotensive and bradycardic, ultimately requiring
dobutamine and levophed with minimal improvement in MAP. UOP
declined, lactate rose to 14.
.
Family meeting with patients family and oncologists on [**2157-11-30**].
Family ultimately decided that patient should have no further
escalation of care. Later that evening, patient's BP and HR
began to decline, and she passed away peacefully with family by
bedside. Family agreed to an autopsy to shed light on the cause
for her hypoxia/pulmonary dysfunction as well as for the
subacute worsening of hemodynamic status, decreased UOP, and
elevated lactate.
