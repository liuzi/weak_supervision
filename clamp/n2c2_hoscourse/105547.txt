Pt was admitted through the emergency room after transfer from
OSH for perimesencephalic hemorrhage after working out at gym.

Pt was placed on dilantin and nimodipine and and a-line was
placed. Systolic BP was controlled to less than 140. A cerebral
angiogram was done on [**2163-4-17**] which was negative for aneurysm.

A CXR was done on [**2163-4-18**] for low O2 sats and dark sputum.  The
findings were suggestive of pneumonia vs. aspiration however the
pt is afebrile without elevated WBC, so no antibiotics were
started at this time.  A blood gas was obtained that showed
poosr oxygenation.  This was discussed with the ICU attending
and CTA of the chest was then oobtained without evidence of PE.
Pt was supported on increasing amounts of O2 throughout the
night and on the am  of [**2163-4-19**] it was decided that he would
need ventilatory support.  Prior to intubation he was mentating
well and his neuro exm remianed stable.  Consent for HIV testing
was obtained and found to be negative.  Bronchoscopy for sputum
culture and or mucous plugging was performed. Lasix gtt was
started for ARDS treatment. He required mechanical ventilation
and was weaned to room air on [**4-20**] a CXR showed improved
bibasilar opacities prior to transfer to floor.

He was monitored on the surgical floor for 3 days and had a
repeat CTA which showed a
Normal CT of the head with no evidence of aneurysm formation.
Mild vasospasm
is noted at the distal basilar artery. He was cleared for
discharge he had no focal neurological deficits on discharge and
