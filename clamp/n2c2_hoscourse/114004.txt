67 yom with history of a.fib, on pradaxa, now presenting with
worsening BRBPR and hematuria
.
# GI Bleed: Patient was monitored in the MICU overnight for GIB
given pradaxa use.  He remained normotensive throughout his MICU
stay without drop in Hct.  He was evaluated by GI who felt no
urgent colonoscopy was needed, and symptoms were likely
secondary hemorrhoidal and exacerbated by anticoagulation.  He
was transferred to the medical floor where he remained stable
o/n.  After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the patient's out- patient
cardiologist, given the fact that he has been in sinus for the
better part of a year and has not flipped into AFIB he was d/c'd
on full dose ASA with GI f/u scheduled.
.
# UTI: Patient was started on ciprofloxacin for UTI as evidenced
by UA and dysuria.  He was subsequently switched to cefpodoxime
given concern for prolonged QTc in combination with amiodarone.
Micro showed a sensitive E. Coli.
.
# Afib: Patient remained in sinus rhythm.  Anticoagulation was
initially held, then switched to ASA as above.

# [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine was 2.0 on admission, improving to 1.2 the
following day and 1.0 on the day of discharge.  Thought to be
secondary to volume depletion.

# Wheezing: Patine twas initially slightly wheezy on exam
thoguht to be sedcondary to mild volume overload.  The following
day pulmonary exam had improved, patient was comfortable on room
air.  He refused scripts for inhalers at home, saying he only
needs them when he is sick.

.
# Hypertension: Home medications initially held in the MICU,
were restarted after patient demonstrated hemodynamic stability
and transferred to the floor.  Did well from this standpoint
until discharge.
