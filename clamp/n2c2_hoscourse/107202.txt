Initial Assessment:

Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] is a 49 y/o woman with a PMH significant for
myelodysplastic syndrome, HTN and hypothyroidism, who presents
with sudden onset left sided weakness. On her exam, her NIHSS is
17 and she has a dense left sided hemiparesis as well as right
gaze deviation, left hemianopia and neglect. Her imaging shows
an
occlusion of R MCA near its origin. Her history, exam and
imaging
are consistent with acute embolic stroke in R MCA. The time of
onset was taken to be 0130; the time of her thrashing, and so
when she was seen here, she remained within the window for IV
tPA. The decision was made to proceed with the IV tPA. The plan
at this time is to proceed with tPA infusion and if clinical
exam
remains unchanged in 30 minutes, then plan is to proceed with
angio for IA tPA vs. Merci.
