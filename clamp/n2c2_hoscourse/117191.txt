Ms. [**Known lastname 38758**] is a 34F with mixed connective tissue disease on
medical immunosuppression with prednisone and leflunamide and
recurrent digit osteomyelitis who returns with fevers and lip
swelling.
.
#Angioedema: The patient was evaluated by Allergy who felt the
most likely etiology was the newly started ACEI (started 5d
prior to noted symptoms). There was never any evidence of
respiratory compromise, hypotension or other signs concerning
for anaphylaxis. Allergy serologies (tryptase, C1 inhibitor and
C2) are pending at time of discharge. Steroids were transitioned
to  oral. On discharge patient was scheduled to complete steroid
taper over 3 days (20mg x1d, 10mg x1d, 7.5mg ongoing as home
dose). She received pepcid and benadryl x48h and then
fexofenadine x48h. The presenting lip swelling, tingling
resolved within 24h and remained absent during her admission.
She is scheduled for follow-up with Allergy within 1 week of
discharge. She was instructed to avoid ACEI in the future. The
potential use of [**Last Name (un) **] in this setting remains controversial and
formal recommendations regarding future use of [**Last Name (un) **] was deferred
to the Allergy service.
.
#Fever: Initial fever and bandemia were concerning for
infection. Patient remained afebrile after initial T103F on
admission. Of note, there was consideration for prednisone
related fever suppression and the patient was advised to
continue to monitor for fever during prednisone taper following
discharge.
.
Per discussion with Allergy, ACE related angioedema was likely
not an etiology in fever. Most likely sources were felt to be
(1) persistent osteomyelitis of the R digits versus (2) CVC
endovascular infection. After coordinated discussion with the
patient's in-patient and out-patient attendings (ID,
Rheumatology, Surgery, Medicine) the decision was made to remove
the port. Rationale included (a) prior positive CVC culture with
CoNS in the setting of CoNS growing from R hand OR cultures, (b)
persistent port site tenderness, (c) limited anticipated use of
Port for next several months [immunosuppressive regimen is being
deferred until completion of Fluconazole course which is
anticipated to end in [**2145-11-30**]], (d) potential future risk
for fungal colonization given known Candidal osteomyelitis.
There was low concern for other mechanisms of infection
including resistant organisms ([**Female First Name (un) 564**] noted as Fluc sensitive,
MSSA, CoNS both Vancomycin sensitive), non gram positive
organisms (Bld Cx remained negative during this admission;
Bld/Port Cx x2), metastatic infection (recent TTE negative for
vegetation, no focal si/sx suggestive of other metastatic sites
including spleen/abdomen and spine).
.
She will be scheduled for Port removal with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (PA is
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8817**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) who will assist in coordination of PICC
placement. She was evaluated by the IV team prior to discharge
who felt out-patient PICC placement with consideration for IR
guidance was an appropriate plan. Of note, the removed
Port-A-Cath tip should be sent for culture (bacterial, fungal,
AFB).
.
#HTN: Patient's blood pressures remained 130-150s/80s-110s.
Metoprolol was increased from 25mg [**Hospital1 **] to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] with
improvement in blood pressures. Additional regimen changes were
deferred to the outpatient setting following steroid taper,
given potential steroid related contribution to noted
hypertension. Patient experienced Metoprolol related GI
upset/dysphagia which resolved with administration w/ food.
Patient additionally expressed concern re: potential side
effects re: Raynaud's and beta blockade. Of note, prior
literature supports safety of use of metoprolol specifically in
the setting of Raynaud's.
.
# Mixed connective tissue disease: Her home immunosuppressants
were continued and she is to follow-up with rheumatology as
outpatient. She was instructed to hold Mobic (an NSAID) pending
surgical Port-A-Cath removal.
.
#Post-operative Pain: Patients pain regimen was continued. MS
Contin was increased from 15mg [**Hospital1 **] to 20mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Anemia: Hematocrit was stably 30-32 during admission. Iron
studies were suggestive of mixed Fe-deficiency anemia and anemia
of chronic disease (Fe 31, TIBC 328, Ferritin 66). She was
written for FeSulfate on discharge with follow-up Fe studies
deferred to the patient's primary care physician.
