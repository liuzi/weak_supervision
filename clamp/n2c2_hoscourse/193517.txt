83 yo male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
STEMI and RCA stent in [**2127**], anterior STEMI [**2137-2-21**] with 2
overlapping BMS to proximal LAD, anterior STEMI [**2137-3-1**] with
stent thrombosis, DMII, HTN, and CRI.

# CAD/Ischemia:  Status post STEMI and RCA stent in [**2127**],
anterior STEMI [**2137-2-21**] with 2 overlapping BMS to proximal LAD,
anterior STEMI [**2137-3-1**] with stent thrombosis.  Patient presented
with anterior STEMI with ST elevations V1-V4 and ST depressions
in II III and aVf.  By cardiac angiography he was found to have
completely occluded proximal LAD, 80% occlusion of the Lcx and
complete proximal occlusion of the RCA with distal flow from
collaterals. The LAD lesion was opened by angioplasty and a bare
metal stent was placed.  During the procedure the patient became
hypotensive with episodes of V Tach and V fib requiring multiple
cardioversions.  After emesis he was intubated for airway
protection. He was then transfered to the CCU and started on
[**Month/Day/Year **], plavix, and heparin. On [**2137-3-1**] pt developed chest pain
while at rest and was found to have anterior ST elevations in
V1-V3. He was treated with nitroglycerin, O2, and morphine which
resulted in alleviation of his symptoms. At cardiac
catheterization he was found to have an LAD stent thrombosis
that was opened with balloon angioplasty resulting in improved
flow through the LAD stent.  He remains on Toprol XL 25mg daily,
[**Last Name (LF) 17339**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and Plavix daily.
.
# Pump: At presentation the patient developed cardiogenic shock
and was found to have a PCWP of 40 with VEF 20% by echo with 3+
MR, and septal and anterolateral ventricular akenesis.  An IABP
was not used becasue the patient has a tortutous aorta.  He was
initially started on dopamine. In the first 24 hours post cath
he developed several episodes of sinus bradycardia and
hypotension when attempting to wean down the dopamine that
required atropine boluses on one occasion. He was transitioned
to levophed on [**2-23**]. Metoprolol was started on [**2-24**]. After
maintaining pressure well he taken off levophed on [**2-26**]. On [**3-1**]
he developed dyspnea and appeared fluid overloaded on clinical
exam and has begun on Lasix for diuresis.  On the day of
discharge the lasix dose was increased to 80mg daily.  This can
be titrated based on fluid status and blood pressure parameters.
 ACE-I/ARBs was held due to concerns for renal function; if
renal function recovers to baseline, we would strongly
recommended ACE inhibitor therapy for decreased EF. Will need to
have creatinine and potassium checked in 2 days at rehab
facility. Needs strict intake/output measurement along with
daily weights.
.
# Rhythm: During cardiac catherization patient had ventricular
tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation that required multiple
cardioversions to regain perfusing rhythm. At that time he was
then started on amiodarone drip.  He was transfered to the CCU
in NSR and the amiodarone was discontinued.  On [**2-23**] and then
again on [**2-24**] he developed atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular repsonse in the context of attempted ventilator
weens.  Both episodes were treated with amiodarone and
metoprolol and he returned to NSR. Since [**2-24**] he has been in NSR
on daily metropolol and amiodarone.  He is also on coumadin.
Coumadin dose was held on [**3-25**] for supratherapeutic INR.
Plan is to restart coumadin on [**3-6**], INR on [**3-5**] at the time of
discharge was 3.1, was receiving a dose of 5mg, patient was
being loaded on amiodarone. The dose of amiodarone will be
decreased and it is reasonable to initiate warfarin at 5mg and
check frequent INR level to ensure he is not supratherapeutic
and adjust as necessary.
.
# Respiratory: During cardiac arrest the patient vomitted and
was intubated for airway protection.  He was removed from
mechanical ventilation on [**2-25**]. Since, he has used up to 3L O2
by nasal canula after patient reported subjective dyspnea though
he has maintained 02 saturations above 95%.  After ecoli was
found in a sputum culture he completed a course of
ciprofloxacin. He has had episodes of dyspnea with elvated JVP
and lower extremity edema, and signs of CHF on CXR;  Diuresis
with lasix was begun on [**3-1**].  The dose was uptitrated from 40mg
PO lasix to 80mg PO lasix based on increased pulmonary edema on
CXR.  VQ scan was low probability for pulmonary embolism on
[**3-4**].

# CKD: Cr 1.4-1.8 at baseline. During initial cardiac
catheterization he received  600cc dye load and  had episodes of
hypotension. He arrived to the CCU with a Non AG acidosis of
unclear etiology that resolved over the next several days. His
Cr peaked on [**2-23**] at 4.4 and then declined steadily declined to
2.4 on [**3-4**] despite receiving another 60cc dye load on [**3-1**].  He
never required HD, although renal consult team followed closely.
He will need renal follow up as an outpatient.

# DVT: Despite therapeutic heparin levels, patient developed a
right sided femoral to popliteal DVT discovered on ultrasound on
[**2-28**]. As mentioned above VQ scan was negative. He was maintained
on heparin and then transitioned to coumadin. Because of DVT
despite heparin for ACS on presentation and antiplatelet therapy
peri-MI as well as in-stent thrombosis on adequate antiplatelet
therapy, concern for hypercoagulable state is high and pt should
have full hypercoagulable work up once other issues are stable.
.
# R arm cellulitis: In addition he developed an infiltrated
right forearm venous access site that became ecchymotic and
tender and was presumptive treated with cefelaxin for concern of
a possible cellulitis.
.
# BPH: Restarted on Flomax on day of discharge.
