#. Shock: Felt initially most likely due to sepsis and he was
covered broadly with antibiotics.  Initially broadened
antibiotics to vanc/levo/cefepime to cover above sources.  Goal
CVP was [**9-21**], MAP > 65.  Initial central venous O2 saturation
was 91%.  Patient was transferred from floor to ICU on dopamine
and neo; dopamine was converted to levophed.  Pulsus was normal
at 5.  Echocardiogram as above, largely unremarkable.
Hypotension persisted and was thought to be septic in etiology
with IL-2 distributive physiology contributing.  Shock was
refractory to fluid boluses; received normal saline and water
with bicarb given renal failure.  Blood cultures eventually grew
out MRSA, successive cultures negative until [**2124-3-10**], with
[**2124-3-10**] culture growing vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
During this time, patient was actually weaned off pressors.  The
right subclavian triple lumen was removed and a right internal
jugular triple lumen was placed.  Goals of care were discussed
with family, who requested continued aggressive treatment.
Linezolid replaced vancomycin for VRE bacteremia. The patient's
pressures stabilized and pressors were discontinued.  He did not
have further hypotension after transfer to the oncology floor.

# MRSA/VRE bacteremia: S/p line removals; Patient completed 15
day course of linezolid.  Also added Meropenem on [**3-24**] given MS
decline and asterixis.  Antibiotics were d/c'd on [**3-25**] and
patient has been stable, afebrile without leukocytosis since.
Repeat blood and urine cultures have been negative.

# partial/early SBO: On [**3-25**] patient developed worsening
abdominal distention and confusion.  This early SBO was likely
due to narcotics though concerning that is ongoing and limiting
nutrition. MRI head with improved findings. An NGT was placed
for 24 hours and the patient's MS cleared as did his SBO.  There
was initially some concern for messenteric ischemia given guiaic
positive stool, known necrotic fingers and subsequent CT abd
findings, so GI and surgery were consulted.  Patient however
soon improved clinically so further work-up with colonoscopy was
not done.  He was able to tolerate a regular diet for 48H prior
to discharge. A PICC had been placed for access and for ability
to start TPN if needed, however TPN was never started.

# Anemia: likely multifactorial due to poor nutrition, acute
nutrition, and marrow suppression.  Patient is also FOB+ s/p 2U
PRBC since [**3-17**]. then another 1U [**3-24**].  He was continued on iron,
folate and B12 on [**3-27**].  Mr. [**Known lastname 2795**] did have guiaic positive
stools during admission which should be followed-up  by
gastroenterology as an outpatient.

# gangrene: [**3-14**] pressors, shock as below.  Patient was treated
with wound care and transitioned to a fentanyl patch with
breakthrough morphine for pain.

# thrombocytopenia: Resolved. Likely due to myelosuppression.

# coagulopathy: Patient was supplemented with vitamin K X3 days
to decrease his INR.

#  Respiratory failure- Patient was intubated electively in
setting of persistent hypervolemia and renal failure.
Maintained on minimal ventilatory support during dialysis.
Patient received antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was extubated on [**2124-3-15**] and continued to improve
significantly. The patient was called out to the OMED floor team
for further managment.

#. ARF: IL-2 mediated ARF most likely, however prerenal or
postrenal etiology also possible.  K wnl, phos elevated though
stable from last draw.  Patient likely had IL-2 induced renal
injury, with possible ischemic acute tubular necrosis.  Despite
aggressive fluids, renal function did not improve.  Patient was
showing signs of uremia and hypervolemia, and continuous
[**Last Name (un) **]-venous hemodialysis was started following intubation and
placement of HD line.  On the last days of admission he did not
require diuresis and continued to auto-diurese with a creatinine
of 1.1-1.3. He was not continued on his anti-hypertensives as
his SBPs were 130-140. Mr. [**Known lastname 2795**] should have his renal function
checked as an outpatient in the next 1-2 weeks. If there are
concerns with worsening kidney function as an oupatient, he
should be followed by renal.

#  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response- Occurred
on morning of [**2124-3-7**].  Became more hypotensive, received two
attempts at DC cardioversion, transient sinus rhythm restored,
then converted back into a. fib.  Amiodarone load and drip was
started.  Converted to sinus rhythm day later, maintained on
amio drip.  Cardiac enzymes were flat, lower extremity
ultrasound negative for DVT.  Repeat TTE showed no right heart
strain. The amiodarone drip was discontinued and the patient
remained in normal sinus rhythm.

#. HA/MS changes: Known metastatic disease to brain and IL-2 can
cause swelling.  He is AOx3, though slightly agitated.  Clinical
picture not c/w meningitis/encephalitis and most likely
toxic-metabolic.  CT head showed slight improvement in
metastatic disease, less vasogenic edema.  Lumbar puncture was
deferred given intracranial mass. As patient stayed on the
oncology floor his mental status gradually returned to [**Location 213**].
He can have a formal neurocognitive outpatient work-up if deemed
necessary by his PCP.

# skin/eye/mucous membrane breakdown: Patient developed
significant skin breakdown, particularly on his fingertips
likely due to pressors and IL-2.  He was evaluated by plastic
surgery and hand x-ray found no need for intervention.  He was
continued on: nystatin, miconazole, benadryl, sarna, Hydrocerin,
HydrOXYzine, eye drops, Gelclair.

#. RCC: finished week 2 of IL-2. Maintained contact with
outpatient oncologist.
