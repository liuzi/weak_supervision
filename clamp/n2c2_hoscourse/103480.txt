52F admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after transfer from OSH following a
witnessed syncopal episode. Head CT performed showing diffuse
SAH. CTA of head also performed with preliminarily identified an
aneurysm at the left ICA bifurcation. She was loaded with
dilantin, and started on nimodipine, and emergent bedside
external ventricular drain was placed. She also had a cardiac
echo done for concerns of a catacholamine induced
cardiomyopathy(had developed pulmonary edema), which showed
significantly depressed cardic function. She was placed on a
[**Last Name (un) 18821**] monitor to more closely monitor for this. She had an
angiogram done on [**6-4**], when the left distal ICA aneurysm was
coiled. She then returned to the ICU postoperatively.
On [**6-5**](overnight) she had a ICP elevation to 50 and the drain
was promplty dropped to 10cm, and ICP normalized. Emergent head
CT was done which showed likely evolving brifrontal
hypoattenuations/possible stroke. She again returned to angio on
[**6-6**] to further evaluate vascualar patency given this new CT
finding.The patient was febrile with a Tmax 101.6 and was pan
cultured,the urine and cerebral spinal fluid cultures were both
neagtive. On [**6-6**] The Dobutamine intravenous drip was off,
vasopressors Levophed and neo cont.  The Nimodipine cut in [**12-21**]
to maintain goal blood pressures. The patient was brought to
angio, there was no significant spasm and given 5mg
verapamil-aneurysm stable.  Blood cultures were found to be
negative.  The sputum culture was positive for rare yeast.On
[**6-7**]: The patient had an acute PaO2 decrease to 50%.  There was
a concern for Pulmonary embolusE.  The CTA of the Chest was not
consistent with Pulmonary embolus. The CT Head was unchanged.
The patient was moniotored for possible Central Diabetes
Insipidus. The urine and sputum cultures were both negative. On
[**6-8**],  The patient was pan-cultured for a fever to 102. A head
CT ordered for elevated ICP to 44, Mannitol was initiated for
increased ICPs. A CTA was performed which was consistent with a
slight decrease in intercranial vasospasm. On [**6-9**], The patient
required 3 doses of mannitol for sustained ICP levels of 23.
There were no changes in the patients mental status with these
ICP increases.On exam the patient was intermitently following
commands in the right upper extremity, the left upper extremity
moved to command, the left lower extremity and Right upper
extremity withdrew to pain,the patients eyes were open and
tracked with her eyes. On [**6-10**], The patient was back on a
dobutamine gtt continuously to maintain a goal blood pressure,
The patient had a TEE which was consistent with Ejection F of
20%. The LENIS were negative for deep vein thrombosis, The CSF
and sputum cultures were negative. On [**6-11**], The patient
underwent an angio which was consistent with mild to mod
vasospasm.  She recieved 2 doses of verapamil.Nimodipine at 15mg
every 2 hours was restarted. On [**6-12**], The patient was bolused
with dilantin 300mg for a 7.9 level.  The Head CT was repeated
and was stable. The patient was extubated and stopped nimodpine
for systolic blood pressure in 60's.The goal MAP > 100 and
dobutamine was restarted.

[**6-14**] CT shows:new stroke in the posterior left MCA distribution
CTA shows diffuse, severe vasospasm involving the bilateral MCAs
(left worse than right)the following day she underwent a
cerebral angiogram which showed Mild to moderate spasm Left A1,2
and M1,2 segments though her exam seemed to slightly improve
with brisk localization on LUE and localization on RUE though
not as brisk as left. She had some intermittent eye opening. A
stroke neurology consult was obtained and they agreed with our
continued HHH management and requested starting a Statin.

On [**6-17**], she was again febrile, and pan cultured. CVL
access was changed and catheter tip sent. OR was cancelled for
the day for her temperature, and possibly to re-attempt [**6-19**] or
[**6-20**] if afebrile and no positive cultures. Positive blood cx from
arterial line and appearance of axillary A line, concerned for
line infection and she was treated for line associated
bacteremia for 7 day course.  PEG placed by surgery team on
[**2165-6-26**] without event.   Meds and diet were advanced through PEG
as recommended without issue.

On discharge her neurological exam she preferred her eyes closed
would open to voice, questionable following commands  with left
side. She is essentially plegic on right side but will withdraw
both arm and leg to pain. Her pupils are 4mm and reactive, her
incision are well healed. She was tolerating her tube feeds
without difficulty. Speech and swallow recommends video swallow
before initiating any oral feeds.
