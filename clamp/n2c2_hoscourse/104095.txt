She was admitted to the Surgical Service and taken to the
operating room for exploratory lap, ileostomy takedown with
ileo-transverse colostomy on [**6-21**]. There were no intraoperative
complications. Postoperatively she has done fairly well, her
diet was advanced slowly; she is having bowel movements. She was
started on Imodium and Metamucil to help minimize frequent
stools. Her ileostomy site is being packed with moist to dry
dressing changes [**Hospital1 **]; her staples will remain in place until
next week when she follows up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Her medications
were changed from intravenous to oral, she is tolerating these
without difficulty; appetite is good. Her fluids and
electrolytes have been monitored closely and repleted
accordingly. Her most recent sodium on [**6-28**] was 145.

The wound ostomy nurse specialists were consulted because of
dermatitis issues; Nystatin cream was recommended to these
areas. Miconazole powder is being used to her perineal region.
