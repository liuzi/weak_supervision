44F with metastatic NSCLC (brain, bilat adrenals, bilat kidneys)
p/w frank hematuria, anemia, renal failure. The bleeding was
from renal mets and was localized to the L kidney based on blood
seen coming from the L ureter at cystoscopy. The renal failure
was believed to be due to a combination of ATN, mets, and
contrast. Ultimately she was started on HD. The L kidney was
embolized to prevent further bleeding. She is now HD dependent.
Her hospitalization has been further complicated by pneumonia
and adrenal insufficiency.

Ultimately, after a trial of dialysis, the pt opted to be CMO.
However, when she did not pass over a weekend, she considered
this a sign that she could live longer and possbily survive
cancer. A family meeting was convened and an accommodation was
achieved wherein we would restart abx and try to relieve her of
her anasarca using either diuretics or ultrafiltration. That
said, after failing diuretics and prolonged difficulties with
the dialysis catheter, another meeting was convened. Antibiotics
were stopped again and the patient was returned to [**Location 3225**] with
ultrafiltration. During an ultrafiltration treatment, she went
into respiratory failure and passed.
