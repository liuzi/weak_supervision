This is an 86yo woman with dementia and h/o recent left MCA
stroke complicated by persistent aphasia and hemiparesis
admitted with acute hematocrit drop and guaiac positive stool.
.
# Anemia: Pt has chronic anemia w/ baseline Hct 25-27.
Hemolysis work-up was negative.  Acute drop in Hct was thought
to be from GI source.  Pt's Hct bumped appropriately with 2u RBC
transfusions, and she was monitored for 1 day in MICU, where she
remained hemodynamically stable.  GI was consulted, and given
her family's desire for minimal intervention, she was managed
conservatively with PPI, Hct checks, and PRN transfusions.  She
was also taken off ASA ppx for stroke, in setting of GIB.
Although labs do not show iron deficiency, she was supplemented
as she may continue to have GIB.  Her Hct remained stable at ~25
on day of discharge.  She should have her hematocrit checked on
the day after discharge.  Her hematocrit should be regularly
monitored afterwards according to her attending doctor's
discretion, but we would advise that another Hematocrit be
checked this [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**10-2**], and that she be transfused
as needed to keep her Hct at baseline ~ 25
.
# Hypernatremia:  Pt arrived with sodium of 153, which was
thought to be due to free water deficit from poor access to
water.  She was gently hydrated with D5W and her hypernatremia
resolved and has remained within normal range.
.
# Elevated troponin:  Patient unable to verbalize chest pain.
EKG does not show changes from prior tracing 3 weeks ago.  Her
troponin remained stable at 0.03 after 3 sets of enzymes.  She
was continued on home simvastatin.
.
# s/p Left MCA stroke: Continues to have significant aphasia and
right sided weakness.  Keppra was continued.  ASA was held in
setting of active bleed.
.
# HTN:  Remained HD stable throughout hospitalization with good
BP control.  Norvasc was held b/c of GI bleed, but discharge
instructions were to re-start her anti-hypertensive medications
at her long term care facility if she remained hemodynamically
stsable.
.
# h/o cataracts and glaucoma:  Pt was continued on levobunolol.
She was given xalatan eye drops instead of travatan due to
formulary issues.
.
# Heel ulcer: Stage 1 pressure ulcer was identified this
admission. The pt's legs were kept in waffle boots to minimize
pressure to this area.
