Assessment and Plan: 75 year old woman on Coumadin and Plavix,
s/p mechanical MVR, h/o GI bleed (ten years ago), now presenting
with GI bleeding in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR, c/b
nasal bleeding following NGT placement.
.
# GI Bleed: The pt had three melenotic stools over 24 hrs, but
has stable hct on labs and is otherwise asymptomatic (without
fatigue, shortness of breath with exertion, chest pain, or
orthostasis). NG lavage was negative for any coffee ground
material or bloody contents. EGD did not reveal any source of
bleed. The patient also underwent colonoscopy, revealing a
bleeding AVM, which was coagulated using thermal therapy. She
will need a capsule endoscopy as an out-patient in order to
assess for additional, non-visualized AVM in the small bowel.
She was monitored with serial hematocrits, which trended
downward precipitating transfusion with 1 unit of blood. Her
anti-coagulation with Plavix and Coumadin was held for her
procedures. After, she was re-started on coumadin with a heparin
bridge to therapeutic INR, and her plavix was restarted after
being held for 7 days.  Her hematocrit was stable at discharge.
She was discharged once INR was therapeutic.
.
# Nasal trauma: Following NGT placement, pt developed bleeding
from nose that was quite profuse. Packing was placed by ENT
which was dislodged overnight. We suspect that a minor
lac/contusion from NG tube in the setting of elevated INR
precipitated this event. She experienced no further epistaxis
during this admission.
.
# Mechanical MV replacement: Goal INR is 2.5-3.5. The patient is
on a higher dose of Coumadin (5.5mg) to maintain this INR. Per
discussion with cardiology, her anti-coagulation was not
reversed. All anticoagulation was held pending her EGD, and she
was started on a heparin drip afterwards. After her colonoscopy,
she was restarted on Coumadin and a heparin drip was used to
bridge the patient until her INR was therapeutic. At discharge,
her INR was 2.6.
.
# CAD s/p 1 vessel CABG [**2177**]: The patient's beta blocker was
initially held so as not to mask hypovolemia. It was re-started
after the patient's procedures with normal heart rate and
excellent blood pressure control.
.
# TIA's (on plavix): Plavix was restarted after being held for a
total of 7 days after her colonoscopy.
