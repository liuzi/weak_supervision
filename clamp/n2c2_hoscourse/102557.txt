A/P: 67 yo male, h/o severe 3vd, RA, presenting from OSH with
?biliary sepsis, s/p ERCP with stent placed, being treated for
urosepsis vs biliary sepsis, extubated and doing well.

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial picture was consistent with
septic + cardiogenic shock. Initial SG numbers revealed high
SVR, low CO, and high PCWP. He remained hypotensive despite IVF,
and pressors were continued, with eventual triple pressor
therapy (Levo, Dopamine and Vasopressin) required for
hemodynamic support. A random cortisol was 20, and 29
post-cosyntropin. Despite appropriate response, the low random
cortisol prompted initiation of steroid therapy, initially
Dexamethasone, then hydrocortisone and Fludrocortisone with plan
to complete 7 days of Rx (completed). His lactate, elevated on
admission, came down. He was successfully weaned off Levo and
Vasopressin on [**2195-12-28**], then off Dopamine on [**2195-12-29**]. ERCP did
not show obstruction, ?biliary sludge.  He was initially on
vanco/zosyn/flagyl-->cipro/vanco/flagyl.  Vanco/flagyl were
discontinued on [**12-27**] (c. diff neg x 3), and he will continue a
course of cipro for ?urosepsis.  All cultures here have been
NGTD, but he is being treated for [**4-26**] E. coli blood culture
bottles at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**].  Ciprofloxacin was continued for the 14 day
course (until [**1-9**]).  He was hemodynamically stable throughout
hospitalization.  Blood pressure medications were initially held
[**2-23**] hypotension.  Lisinopril was restarted prior to discharge
after renal function improved.  Atenolol was held given patient
was still on amiodarone taper.  This should be restarted after
he follows up with his PCP/cardiologist.

2. NSTEMI: The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by
troponin elevation felt secondary to demand in the setting of
acute illness (peak troponin 1.86). He received 48 hours of
intravenous heparin, D/C'd in the setting of thrombocytopenia.
An echo was performed on [**12-25**], which revealed severe global LV
hypokinesis with EF<25%. Cardiology followed in-house.
Lisinopril, ASA, were continued. Lipitor was added upon
discharge at a lower dose, and atenolol was held.  This should
be restarted when amiodarone taper is completed and he follows
up with his primary cardiologist.  He also had an echo in-house
showing a very depressed EF (<25%), likely [**2-23**] myocardial
suppression from sepsis.  He should have a follow up TTE after
discharge from rehab.

3. Afib: Patient went into atrial fibrillation on [**12-25**] with RVR
and hypotension. Cardioversion was attempted without success. He
was loaded with amiodarone IV and an amiodarone drip was
initiated. He converted to NSR in PM. Then, he reverted back
into afib on [**12-26**] after an increase in dopamine dose to 3
(?true-true and unrelated?). Given low cardiac output and
ongoing hypotension requiring 3 pressors, cardioversion was
performed with conversion to NSR after a single 200J shock. The
patient was switched to PO amiodarone on [**12-26**], to be continued
TID until [**1-2**], then [**Hospital1 **] for 1 week, then QD for 1 week, then
200 mg PO QD until cardiology follow-up. He remained in NSR
throughout hospitalization after transfer out of the unit.  His
atenolol was held and should be restarted after he finishes his
amiodarone taper and follows up with his cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  He was started on fondaparinux/coumadin for
anticoagulation (afib and low EF).  Goal INR is [**2-24**],
fondaparinux can be d/c'ed when INR=1.8.

4. ARF on CRF: Per patient's PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], baseline
creatinine around 1.3-1.5. Peak creatinine 3.0 at OSH. Mr. [**Known lastname **]
was initially oliguric on admission. His urine output slowly
improved with better hemodynamics, with slowly improving
creatinine. Urine lytes suggestive of renal etiology (likely ATN
[**2-23**] hypotension from sepsi), and urine sediment bland. Currently
2.1, and auto-diuresing and mobilising fluid. RUS without
evidence of hydronephrosis or other abnormality.  His creatinine
returned to baseline (1.3) and was stable on discharge.  He
diuresed very well on IV lasix (goal 2L/d).  He was discharge on
PO bumex 1 mg daily.  This should be continued until he is
clinically euvolemic and his peripheral edema is resolved.

5. Transaminitis: s/p ERCP with stent placement, but only
finding of sludge. Query transaminitis in setting of sepsis.
LFT's were back to normal at time of discharge.  They should be
checked within a week of discharge.  Lipitor was restarted at
lower dose upon discharge and can be titrated up.

7. Thrombocytopenia: While in ICU, platelets were noted to drop
to a nadir in the 80s. Concern for HIT was raised and Heparin
was discontinued after 48 hours of therapy. HIT screen negative.
Picture no c/w DIC. Ultimately, thrombocytopenia was felt
medication-induced, query direct effect of Heparin versus
antibiotics (vanco, Flagyl). Now slowly rising.  This was likley
multifactorial in the setting of sepsis, medications, pressors
and not [**2-23**] heparin.  Platelets continued to go up and were
stable at time of discharge.

8.  ?Glucose intolerance: continue on SSI, no history of DM,
likely in setting of steroids for sepsis.  SSI should be
continued as long as pt has abnormal blood sugars.  If this
intolerance persists, PCP should recommend further therapy.

9.  Code: Full

10.  Dispo: Patient was seen by physical therapy in house and
was thought to require acute level rehabilitation for
deconditioning. He was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] Rehabiliation for
physical therapy and diuresis.
