1. Anaphylaxis:  the pt had anaphylactoid reaction to IV
contrast dye during CT as evidenced by acute onset of flushing,
periorbital/facial edema, and hives.  He was treated in the CT
suite with IV benadryl, and was observed to maintain O2 sat 100%
on NRB and had MAP>60 at all times.  He was admitted to the ICU
for ongoing care, and was treated with standing doses of IV
benadryl, famotidine, and solumedrol overnight.  The pt had
stable respiratory status and BP throughout his admission.  By
HD#2, his facial edema and hives had resolved, and he was
transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **] for ongoing care.  On the
medical [**Hospital1 **], he was asymptomatic and tolerated regular diet for
lunch well.  After lunch, he was d/c home with instructions to
take benadryl prn for itching or rash.  The pt was instructed to

2. Chronic pancreatitis:   his pacreatitis has been
long-standing, with evidence of pancreatic calcification on CT
and ERCP consistent with pancreatic ductal stones.  These stones
were not amenable to removal by ERCP, and as they are
contributing to inflammation and pain, the pt was referred for
consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] for surgical treatment.  During
his admission, he was treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement
before meals.  His pain was controlled with IV dilaudid
initially, and on the day of d/c the pt was transition to his
usual regimen of oral morphine, with good results.  He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] for surgical consultation after d/c.
