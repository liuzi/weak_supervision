Assessment and Plan: 44 year old woman with schizoaffective
disorder and SAH s/p coiling L MCA aneurysm transferred from OSH
with with epiglottitis and resp distress now intubated.
.
#. Epiglottitis/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient
initially presented to OSH with sore throat and was found to
have imaging (Neck X ray and CT per report) consistent with
epiglottitis. ABG also consistent with hypercarbia and
respiratory acidosis with concomitant metabolic alkalosis. She
left OSH ED and subsequently presented with stridor and was
intubated for airway protection. Epiglottitis can be caused by
thermal or inhalational injury but is more commonly caused by
infection. The most common bacterial causes include H flu, strep
pneumo, beta hemolytic strep and staph aureus but viral causes
are also possible.  Patient was intially treated with decadron
and empiric ceftriaxne. She was on insulin ss while on steroids.
Rapid resp viral panel sent, antigen was negative, viral
cultures pending at the time of discharge; blood cx sent and
were no growth. Patient was evaluated by ENT with laryngoscopy
while intubated and again after extubation. Initial impression
was that epiglottis was mildly inflamed.  After she was
extubated, she had another endoscopic exam and was noted to have
some vocal cord dysfunction, improved with relaxation techniques
and no obvious epiglottitis. Patient was transferred to the
floor on [**10-3**] and continued to do well. Still had a sore throat,
but no wheezing or shortness of breath, no dysphagia. ENT also
recommended increasing omprazole to 40 mg daily. Have scheduled
outpt ENT follow-up
.
# PEA cardiac arrest- this occured while in ICU, patients pulse
returned after 1 minute or so of chest compressions. Etiology
was felt to be possibly secondary to biting the tube versus
related to propofol. Patient had some pleuritic chest pain
related to chest compressions later in hospital course, treated
with ibuprofen, tylenol and one dose oxycodone. patient has
oxycodone at home still for headaches and continue to take these
as needed for chest pain as well.

#. Anemia: HCT at current baseline 30-32 with high normal MCV.
.
#. h/o SAH and MCA aneurysm s/p coiling [**2130-7-2**] and repeat
coiling [**2130-9-1**]: Neurosurgery aware. No current active
issues
- continue aspirin 325mg PO daily , has f/u scheduled with
Neurosurgery.
.
#. Asthma: Continue albuterol prn (MDI while intubated) although
no current wheezing on exam
.
#. Schizoaffective disorder:
- continued home seroquel
- restarted home benzos, trazodone and gabapentin
.
#. h/o Polysubstance abuse: had urine tox positive for benzos
(gets these rx), amphetamines (on adderal) and barbiturates (on
butalbital for migraines). Denied current substance use.
