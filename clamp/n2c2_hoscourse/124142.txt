This 74-year-old male was initially admitted following an
episode of collapse while at a casino. It is unclear whether
this was a cardiac arrest but after 5 minutes of CPR there was
evidence of a pulse and AED showed a viable rhythm with no shock
advised. He was never defibrillated. During his fall, he hit his
head and sustained a minor laceration to his forehead. At the
OSH he was intubated and cooled as per protocol and loaded with
phenytoin for ? seizures, a CT-head showed only small vessel
disease with no acute changes. In addition, CT-[**MD Number(3) 85050**] OSH
showed no evidence of PE and a borderline dilation of the aorta.
ECG showed AF in 120s. He was tehn transported via [**Location (un) **] to
teh [**Hospital1 18**] ED and was given a stat dose of Pip/Tazo 4.5g IV for
LUL infiltrates present on CXR, was loaded with aspirin 325mg
and clopidogrel 300mg, commenced on a heparin infusion and
metoprolol was started. At this point ECG shoewd AF/A-flutter w/
2:1 block and he was transferred to the CCU. Initial cardiac
enzymes were TnT 0.44 CK-MB 26. And treatment for possible
pneumonia was continued. He was cooled for 24-hours and there
was no evidence of seizure activity on EEG following neurology
review. An echo performed in the context of cooling showed a
mildly dilated LA and severe biventricular systolic dysfunction
with LVEF <20%. When paralytics were weaned, Mr [**Known lastname **] was seen
to be shaking and tehre was no EEG correlate to suggest
seizures. He was weaned off ventilatory supportand CXR showed
resolution of the pulmonary infiltrates. Continued EEG
monitoring was discontinued and neurology were happy that there
was no evidence of seizures. He was extubated on [**2130-8-1**] and
was neurologically appropriate. He required IV hydralazine for
labile BP and his metoprolol was up-titrated. His HB also was
noted to trend down and although stool was guaiac -ve it was
gastroccult +ve and pepcid was changed to PPI. Klebsiella was
grown on sputum from [**2130-8-2**] and IV ceftiaxone was started. He
was weaned off the NG tube and by [**8-4**] passed swallow assessment
and was able to eat and drink. He had mild pulmonary edema
requiring Iv furosemide. Labetalol IV was titrated to BP and
weaned. He complained of rib pain and a CT-chest showed
bilateral psoas hematomas and minimally displaced rib fractures
on 3rd to 11th ribs on R and 3rd to 6th ribs on the left. This
also demonstrated bilateral renal cysts including the largest on
the R which was more solid measuring 34x36mm and suggested o/p
U/S to visualise. In addition there was evidence of bilateral
pleural effusions and a 4mm L upper lobe pulmonary nodule which
should be followed up with a repeat CT in 1 year. He
subsequently developed delirium which required PRN haloperidol
and there was no recurrence of his AF. He pulled out his urinary
catheter on [**2130-8-7**] and failed trial without catheter
resulting in replacement. A repeat echo on [**2130-8-7**] was much
improved with mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis/dysnnchrony of the inferior and
inferiolateral walls and LVEF 45-50%. Due to a rising WBC of 14
and positive urinalysis he was commenced on oral ciprofloxacin
for a presumed UTI. There was evidence of a mild R carotid buit
and carotid U/S demonstrated  mild bilateral disease. He was
commence on amiodarone and warfarin and ECG showed persistent SR
and PVCs. His confusion improved and he had a trial without
catheter on [**8-11**] which was successful and was transferred to
rehab.

# Neurological ?????? Mr [**Known lastname **] was thought initially to be
potentially having seizures and was loaded with phenytoin
although there was no EEG evidence of this. On neurology review,
they were happy that he was not having seizures and one episode
of shaking post weaning sedation was felt to represent rigors.
Following extubation, Mr [**Known lastname **] improved well neurologically
although he developed a delirium picture which was presumed
likely secondary to acute illness. Head CT at the outside
hospital showed no acute changes and although urinalysis x1 was
positive, there has been no growth on urine culture. He also had
urinary retention and the feeling was that this is likely
contributing, as patient??????s mental status significantly improved
after Foley was placed. Patient completed course of ceftriaxone
after sputum culture positive for Klebsiella and CT showed
atelectasis but no frank consolidation, in addition patient has
no clinical signs and symptoms of pneumonia. Haloperidol was
used PRN and he required minimal doses. On discharge he was only
very mildly confused and generally oriented.
.
#. Cardiac arrest: Mr [**Known lastname **] had a collapse while standing at a
casino where he had 5 minutes of CPR and AED showed no shockable
rhythm. It is unknown if pt was truly pulseless or merely
unresponsive. He was cooled as per protocol and although initial
echo while cooled showed a depressed EF <20%, post-rewarming,
this had increased to 40-45% which is very reassuring. Cardiac
enzymes peaked at 0.44 on admission and have trended down since.
No shocks were given throughout course. Only documented rhythms
were AFIB/A-flutter, although has latterly been in sinus. He was
given a loading dose of aspirin and clopidogrel and has been
continued on these. He was commenced on warfarin and will be
slowly increased with INR as of [**8-11**] 1.3.
.
#HTN: Very good BP control latterly although required IV
labetalol/hydralazine as above for labile BP. We will continue
on HCTZ, Lisinopril and toprol.
.
# Afib/A-flutter. On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] Mr [**Known lastname **] was found
to be in AF/A-Flutter and this has not persisted he was started
on amiodarone [**8-9**] and warfarin was loaded although his INRs
latterly have been low and he will likely need an increased
dose. He need close INR monitoring and we are aiming for a goal
range INR [**3-1**]. We will continue Toprol XL. On discharge he was
in SR with PVCs.
.
# New carotid bruit noted - A new right carotid bruit was noted
on [**8-7**] and Carotid series revealed minimal bilateral ICA
plaque, with no appreciable stenosis (graded as less than 40%)
and therefore there is no need for intervention at this time
.
# Rib/hip pain: Pt is s/p CPR and continues to have pain in
hip/lower abdominal area. CT scan shows psoas hematomas which
may be contributing to pain and multiple minimally displaced
bilateral rib fractures. Mr [**Known lastname **] pain has been improving.
.
# New CT-findings. On CT-C/A/P there was evidence of bilateral
renal cysts, the largest on the R which was more solid measuring
34x36mm and suggested o/p U/S to which should be arranged. In
addition there was evidence of bilateral pleural effusions and a
4mm L upper lobe pulmonary nodule which should be followed up
with a repeat CT in 1 year given his smoking history.
.
#Anemia ?????? Mr [**Known lastname **] was noted to have a small drop in HCt and
this was trended and now stable. It is unclear whether this may
be due to poor nutritional state and freq phlebotomy although
guaiac stool was -ve, there was positive guiaic of gastric
contents while intubated. He has now been started on a PPI which
has been increased to [**Hospital1 **]. Of note he was rrecently treated for
H Pylori according to wife so this may also be contributing.
.
# Leukocytosis: Mr [**Known lastname **] had pulmonary infiltrates on CXR and
was treated initially with a stat dose of Pip/Tazo and latterly
ceftriaxone when cultures of sputum grew Klebsiella. He had
previously had low grade temps and has now been apyrexial. Most
recently CXR showed atelectasis with no frank consolidation. All
further cultures and BCs have been negative. He was started on
ciprofloxacin for ? UTI when urinalysis was positive.
.
# Urinary retention: Pt pulled out Foley catheter and subsequent
to re-insertion had urinary retention which resolves. He was
voiding post trial without catheter on [**8-11**] although if he does
go back into retention he will clearly need further
catheterisation and urology follow-up. He was commenced on
tamsulosin.
.
# Dyslipidemia: continue high dose statin
