Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]yo M with a PMH significant for critical AS, CABG x4
and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 82473**] for percutaneous aortic valve
replacement with CoreValve device.

#1 Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis s/p CoreValve [**6-18**]:
At initail deployment, the patient developed near cardiac arrest
with right ventricular akinesis. The aortic valve was quickly
replaced and epinephrine was given with resolution of right
ventricular failure. The right ventriclular function then
returned to the pre-deployment state. The mitral regurgitation
was worsened and severe immediately after this event but after
valve replacement returned to baseline (mild to moderate).
Perioperative permanent pacemaker placed following occlusion of
RCA, has right BBB and paced beats. ECHO shows good valve
placement and mild perivalvular leak. One unit PRBC given post
procedure for low hct. Pt will need aspirin and Plavix for a
total of 3 months and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1022**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32655**] NP for routine post procedure care.
.
#2 Complete Heart Block during CoreValve placement: common
occurance in patients with right bundle branch block. A
[**Company 1543**] DDD pacemaker model Sensia SEDR01,
serial number [**Serial Number 82474**]. One week wound check and
interrogation occurred while pt was still hospitalized and pt
will need to f/u every 6 months for a pacemaker check.

#3 CAD: s/p CABG x 4 ([**2112**]). Bypass graft angiography
demonstrates  the vein graft to the obtuse marginal and the LIMA
to LAD to be  patent, however during CoreValve procedure the RCA
graft was TO. Pt had no significant chest pain during
hospitalization and was discharged on home aspirin, plavix,
metoprolol and Lipitor.
.
#4 Chronic Systolic Dysfunction: EF 35%. Appeared euvolemic at
discharge.
Had not been on ACEi [**1-24**] AS and [**Last Name (un) **]. Would consider starting low
dose ACEi as outpatient. Started Lasix 20 mg PO for inc TR
gradient.
.
# Diarrhea. Possibly due to antibiotics and bowel regimen. No
fever or leukocytosis. Resolved at discharge.
.
# Skin [**Last Name (un) 1994**]. Likely secondary to prednisone. Mild serosanguinous
oozing at site. Wound nurse [**First Name (Titles) 6349**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1994**] and wrote
recommendations to VNA for dressing.
.
#. Polymyalgia Rheumatica: On chronic steroids at home,
continued in hospital.
.
#. CKD: baseline creatinine 1.5. Increased to 1.6, possibly
secondary to intravascular depletion from diuresis/diarrhea. Pt
will have his labs rechecked as an outpatient.
