# Shock:
Patient with hypotension requiring pressors at OSH ED with a
lactate 2.1.  At [**Hospital1 18**] patient was responsive to IVF and weaned
off levophed.   Most likely septic given mild hypothermia, WBC
17.3 and neutrophilia, hypoxia, and CT chest finding c/w
pneumonia.  While it is possible that the leukocytosis may be
secondary to prednisone, the prednisone may also be masking a
fever.  Treated empirically with vanc, zosyn with rapid
improvment. There may have also been a component of hypovolemia
in setting of decreased oral intake at [**Hospital1 1501**] given response to
IVF.  Pt has only been on short taper of prednisone so less
likely adrenal insufficiency although did receive hydrocortisone
at OSH.  Pt with elevated troponin but less likely cardiogenic
shock - may more likely represent end organ damage from
hypoperfusion; no evidence of CHF and BP unlikely to reverse so
quickly.  He was never again hypotensive on the floor and his
white count resolved with IV Abx.  We were never 100% convinced
that this was from pneumonia and a foot CT was checked prior to
discharge to r/o osteomyelitis which showed no evidence of
osteomyelitis. All cultures were negative.
.
Plan going forward:
-Complete 14day course of broad spectrum abx (last day [**5-28**])
-Patient must have CXR in 1 month to f/u for complete resolution
of his PNA/r/o underlying malignancy.
.
# Hypoxia: Patient quickly weaned from NRB to NC to room air.
This was likely related to pneumonia, though volume overload
from resuscitation can not be excluded, or any contribution from
his underlying lung disease.
.
# CAD: Nl CK but elevated trop likely represents demand in
setting of ARF and hypoperfusion rather than an occlusive
lesion. The patient peaked and ruled out on labs in house. EKG
was paced and c/w prior.  Per son, recent stress test
unremarkable.
.
# DM: Patient had issues with o/n low blood sugars, [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted, we dialed back his PM humalog and lantus and his
blood sugar control optimized.
.
# Anemia: Hct here 25.5, was 32.3 at OSH.  Pt is on ASA and
plavix but guaiac negative, no evidence of active bleeding.
Concern for DIC in setting of sepsis although pt currently
appears well. [**Month (only) 116**] have been hemoconcentrated at OSH and now
diluted in setting of 4L IVF. Patient drifted back up to 33
without intervention
.
# Toe pain: Recently s/p LLE stenting; embolic event possible,
but this was thought to be most likely Gout in house. Prior
noted mottling more likely d/t shock than embolus however as b/l
and appears to be improving w/ fluid resuscitation.  No acute
inflammation concerning for gout although has been on
prednisone. Pain unchanged per pt. He underwent CT foot to r/o
osteomyelitis or osteonecrosis as a source, this instead showed
evidence of pseudogout and osteoarthritis.
.
Plan going forward:
Patient has follow-up scheduled with rheumatology
.
#DVT/?PE:  Patient found to have RUE DVT on exam, later found to
have LLL consolidation with resolution of RUE swelling.  Most
likley PE.  Patient to continue lovenox.
.
Plan going forward:
Patient to continue [**Hospital1 **] lovenox for [**4-13**] mo, pending PCP f/u
.
Urinary Retention:
Patient developed new urinary retention while in house.  This
was felt to be secondary to oxycodone which was stopped.  A
foley was placed on the day prior to d/c and the patient was
started on flomax.
.
Plan going forward:
Foley to be d/c'd in 3 days, patient must void spontaneously
8-10 hours following the removal.  If he does not void the floor
physician must be consulted.
