.
1)Transaminitis: The patient presented to the hospital with
sharp epigastric pain and transaminitis on [**8-25**] with ALT/AST in
the [**1-/2120**]'s. During the hospitalization, the ALT and AST
trended down. The epigastric pain resolved by the day after
admission. Several etiologogies were considered for this acute
change in her liver status.  Patient denies using tylenol or
NSAIDs, and tylenol level was not elevated. The only new
medication used was Valtrex for shingles in early [**Month (only) 596**], given
the time that has passed between using the medication and
transaminitis, it is unlikely that this contribued.The patient
also had viral serologies, Hep A/B/C were all negative. CMV was
negative. EBV showed positive IgG and negative IgM. parvovirus
and HSV were negative. Additionally, the patient had autoimmune
work up, whcih was negative for RH, alpha 1 antitrypson,
cerruloplasmn. HSV, [**Doctor First Name **] parvo also negative. The patient is
status post cholecystectomy, and had a MRCP for the
consideration of stone in duct. Sludge was found, pt had
sphincerotomy, and sludge was removed. On [**8-31**], patient
complaining of repeat abd pain, now central on right side. Had
KUB, was normal, had EGD which was normal, small area of
gastritis, Small bowel follow through, normal. Pt has been on
TPN for several years, this was discontinued during the
beginning of the hospital stay. it was restarted on [**9-8**], and
LFTs did not increase at first, but around [**9-1**] they started
increasing slightly but consistently. It is likely that patient
had a stone that was passed, which caused the initial pain
patient felt before coming to the hosptital. Since the Liver
enzymes trended up, she got a liver biopsy on [**9-9**].  Pt's liver
enzymes have been trending down.
.
2) Autonomic Dystonia: longstanding since age 23, at baseline
uses wheelchair, exacerbations in setting of infectious
processes or without clear inducing agents noted. Per movement
disorder specialists her exam has shown severe dystonia with
some atypical features that raise a question of a psychogenic
component as well. During her first week here, while she had the
UTI, she had about 3 episodes of acute dystonia during which she
could not speak. The first was her first night in the hospital
([**8-25**]). When contrast for CT scan was done, she became acutely
dystonic. She got 5mg IV valium, and then 10mg IV valium plus
25mg IV benedryl. She became unresponsive, and was transferred
to the MICU for closer monitoring. She was transferred back to
the floor the next day. She had another episode overnight, which
resolved with 10mg IV valium x2 and 25 benedryl x2. This regimen
has been working for during the hospitization. For less sever
dystonia, she takes valium 5mg IV. Also during this
hospitalization, with neurologies approval, Sinemet was
restarted. she was taken of this medication a few months back.
Pt will be d/cd with PO valium 5mg Q8 prn severe dystonia and
